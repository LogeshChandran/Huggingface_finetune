            "['make sure that the area is a safe place, especially if you plan on walking home at night.  It’s always a good idea to practice the buddy system.  Have a friend meet up and walk with you. Research the bus, train, or streetcar routes available in your area to find safe and affordable travel to your destination.  Make sure you check the schedule for your outgoing and return travel.  Some public transportation will cease to run late at night.  Be sure if you take public transportation to the venue that you will also be able to get home late at night. Check the routes.  Even if some public transit is still running late at night, the routing may change.  Some may run express past many of the stops, or not travel all the way to the ends.  Be sure that your stop will still be available when you need it for your return trip. If you are taking public transit in a vulnerable state after drinking, it is always a good idea to travel in groups.  Having friends available is a good way to stay safe and make sure that you reach your destination. This is more expensive option than a taxi or ride share service, but could be a fun and fancy way to stay safe and ensure that you will have a ride home. Plan this service in advance with a scheduled time to pick you up from your home and the venue.  You want to be sure that the service will still be available when you need to get home. This may be easy in a large city, but taxis may be less frequent in smaller towns.  This is especially true late at night, so this is a less reliable option than scheduling a ride in advance.  Have a friend accompany you and help you flag a cab to make sure you are able to get one. Set up a plan to call a friend when you get home to make sure that you made it safely to your destination. If there are no taxis readily available call a local service to send a car to pick you up. You can share a ride with your friends, or other people using the app at the same moment.  If you are in a vulnerable state it is best to share the ride with your friends to make sure you get home safe. You can request the car to yourself rather than sharing rides with strangers. If you travel home on your own or are the last of your group to be dropped off, make plans to call a friend when you get home so they know you made it safely to your destination. There may be a designated driver service in your area which can chauffeur your group.  Make reservations with them in advance and keep their contact information handy while you are drinking.', \"Designating a driver is a very popular tactic to avoid drinking and driving.  It is important to plan in advance, because your brain function will slow down and your decision making skills will be impaired once you start drinking. Decide before you begin drinking that you will not drive.  Figure out who will be getting you home before you leave. Make sure this person is responsible and keep them in your sight while you are drinking.  Have their contact information handy in case you can’t find them when you are ready to leave.  Choose a friend who doesn’t drink alcohol.  You likely have someone in your friend group who doesn’t drink.  This person is the most likely to remain sober. Decide on one person who will remain sober.  You can take turns within your friend group, alternating who will be the designated driver on each occasion.  Be sure that the designated driver actually remains sober.  The person who has drank the least is still not sober. If you don’t have your car with you, you can guarantee that you won’t make the choice to drive it home. If you are drinking at your home.  Give your keys to a responsible friend to ensure that you don't choose to drive somewhere after you have been drinking. It may be tempting to stay longer or leave with someone else.  Stick to the plan you made in advance and only leave with your sober, designated driver.  Keep the phone number of your driver handy in case you can't find them when you are ready to leave. If your designated driver drinks alcohol, find alternate transportation to get home.\", 'If you have been drinking at all you are at least on the spectrum of drunkenness.  You could be showing signs of impairment and slower brain function including lack of motor skills and slower reaction time, leading to the inability to operate a motor vehicle.  Some of these signs could be:  Poor balance or stumbling.  Difficulty speaking clearly and slurred words.  Abnormal behavior leading to you doing things you wouldn’t normally do if you were sober. As soon as you notice that you are showing signs of impairment, give your keys to a friend, the host or the bartender to ensure that you won’t drive until you are sober.  Make sure to only give them your car key.  Hold onto your house keys. If your friend, the host or the bartender are advising you not to drive, you are likely too drunk.  Listen to their advice and acknowledge that they are trying to help you. Bystander intervention is common when it comes to drinking and driving.  Many people will be willing to step in, take your keys and help you get home safely.  If no one if offering to help, you may need to ask.  Take a ride from a sober friend.  It is best to get in a car with someone you trust when you are in this vulnerable state. Allow the host or bartender to call a cab or car service to take you home. If you are having a difficult time finding a safe way to get home, find a place to stay which does not involve you driving.  Ask the host of the party if there is a place you can sleep.  Give them your keys and ask that they keep them in a safe place until the morning. Stay with a friend if they live nearby and are on their way home. Find a hotel within walking distance.  Call them to book a room, or have a friend help you secure one.  Ask the friend if they will walk you to the hotel and make sure you get checked in safely. There are people in your life who care about you and want to be sure that you are safe.  It may seem scary or embarrassing to call your parents or your siblings if you are too drunk to drive, but they will be glad you did.  Your safety is the most important. You may need your phone to call someone for a ride or get help from a friend.  Be sure to charge your phone before you leave the house.  It is also a good idea to bring a charger with you in case your battery dies before the end of the night or you end up staying where you are and need to get home the next morning. You may also want to invest in a portable battery charger for your phone should there not be a power outlet available.  Make sure it is fully charged before you leave your house.  Keep it handy in your pocket or your bag throughout the night.']\n",

            "   0  At this length, even the smallest amount of regrowth will be obvious, so you will need to trim your hair more often than you regularly would. Because of how often you have to trim it, it would be a good idea to invest in a trimmer and learning how to buzz your own hair. If your hair grows slowly, then you may be able to go 3-4 weeks between haircuts. Again, at this length, even the slightest amount of regrowth becomes visible. Unless you don't mind the frosted-tips look, you will need to redo the entire coloring process on your hair. This includes bleaching and toning as well. Bleaching will damage your hair, but at this length, it won't be as noticeable. Plus, you will eventually buzz it off. This will not only keep your color from fading, but it will also protect your scalp from getting sunburned. If you don't like to wear hats, try a hood or scarf instead. You can also apply some sunscreen or UV protection spray. A hat, scarf, or hood will help keep the color from fading the best. This is the key to keeping your color bright and vibrant. Wash your hair with the coldest temperature you can withstand, and be sure to use shampoo and conditioner formulated for color-treated hair.  Limit yourself to washing your hair only once or twice per week. If you do need to wash your hair between then, stick to plain water. If you can't find products made for color-treated hair, use sulfate-free products instead. Sulfates are harsh cleaning agents that can cause hair dye to fade. When you trim your buzz cut, you'll likely end up cutting all of the dyed portions off and starting with virgin hair. This is a perfect opportunity to wash your scalp with a scalp cleansing shampoo, such as an anti-dandruff or scalp balancing shampoo.  If possible, use sulfate-free shampoo; sulfates can contribute to dryness. Don't wash your hair with scalp cleansing shampoo while it is still dyed, as the shampoo may remove the color. Consider using a scrub on your hair during this time as well. This will help remove the dead skin cells from our scalp.\n",
            "   1  There are four main types of laptops: Netbook, Standard, Hybrid Laptop/Tablet, and Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook. Note that if you are choosing a Mac, your choices will likely not match much of this section.  Netbook - This is the smallest laptop available, and is best suited for heavy travelers. Standard - This is your standard laptop. Suitable for a wide range of situations, and available in a wide range of configurations. Hybrid Laptop/Tablet - These are the newest style of laptops to the scene. They have touch screens and some have detachable keyboards. Desktop Replacement/Ultrabook - These are the largest laptops, and therefore the most powerful (and most expensive). Netbooks are the smallest laptops available, and are perfect for packing in your carry-on or sticking in your purse.   Netbooks are super lightweight, usually only weighing a couple pounds. Netbooks don't have very powerful components, meaning they can only run basic programs such as Office and other productivity software. Because of this, however, they have much longer battery life than other laptops (up to 12 hours in some models).  Netbooks have the smallest screens and keyboards. This means that typing on a netbook will take some getting used to, and you may have to sit pretty close to it. The standard laptop is the most common, and the most varied.   Standard laptops come in a variety of screen sizes. The size of the screen is what determines the overall size of the laptop. The most common size for standard laptops is 14\"-15\". Standard laptops have limited battery life, and the more powerful the laptop, the quicker the battery will drain. Batteries will also wear out over time. Standard laptops are heavier than a netbook, which makes them harder to fit in small bags. They have more comfortable keyboards and larger trackpads. Hybrid laptops are a relatively new addition to the laptop market. Most run Windows 8, which is designed for the touch interface.   The biggest draw of the hybrid is the touch screen. If you prefer this method of input, you may want to consider the hybrid. Hybrid laptops are typically smaller than a standard laptop, and may be able to fold over to become a tablet. Some hybrid laptops allow you to remove the keyboard and work solely as a tablet. Because of their smaller size, hybrids are generally less powerful than a standard laptop. Desktop replacements are the largest and most powerful laptops available. They can run the latest games and have large, easy-to-see displays.   Desktop replacement laptops provide the most power you can get in a portable form. They can often run most of the same programs at the same levels of efficiency as a desktop computer. Because of the increased power, desktop replacements have the worst battery life. This usually isn't an issue if it's always plugged in at your desk, however. The large screen on a desktop replacement means that you don't have to sit as close or squint, and also means that the keyboard will be full-sized. Some desktop replacement laptops have limited upgradability, such as the ability to install a new video card. Desktop replacements are the most unwieldy laptops, and do not travel as well. They are also the most expensive. If your job or lifestyle puts your laptop at risk of getting damaged, you may want to look at the most durable options. This includes steel construction and laptops specifically designed to withstand punishment.  Toughbooks are a type of laptop that is very expensive but much more resilient than a standard laptop. Laptops are public devices, and will be seen by a lot of people as you use it. Make sure you like the way it looks. Many laptops come in various colors or with other aesthetic features. You can also add skins to your laptop later to give it a personal touch.\n",
            "   2  Start by sanding the area with 1000-grit sandpaper, making sure to move very slowly and gently. Once the touched-up area appears close to level with the rest of the pain, continue to sand gently with 2000-grit sandpaper. After that, rub the area with 3000-grit sandpaper until the touch-up paint is even with the rest of the vehicle.  As your sandpaper gets finer, it will remove less and less of the paint. Don’t be tempted to push really hard with the sandpaper because of this. It is ok if you sand a small amount of the surrounding painted area. This will be fixed by the top coat you will apply over the whole area. Paint the top coat over the entire area that is discolored. Typically this includes the chipped area and the existing paint surrounding it that has been lightly sanded. Try to get the top coat as smooth and even as possible, using a clean brush, even strokes, as several thin layers.  Allow your top coat to dry for 10 to 20 minutes between coats. It’s best to apply several thin coats instead of one thick coat. Follow the directions that came on your top-coat container. In some cases they will tell you to apply several coats and in others the directions will state that one coat is enough. Giving the surface one last sanding will ensure that the clear coat you applied is smooth and blended with the existing top coat. Sand it until the repaired area is flush with the rest of the paint surface on the car. and wax the entire car. Once you have repaired your paint chips it’s nice to give your whole car a bit of care. Polishing and waxing the car will help the repaired area blend in with the rest of the paint job and it will protect the fixed area from more damage.\n",
            "   3  Education is, according to the statistics, your best weapon in preventing teen pregnancy. It has been shown repeatedly that the more a teen understands about where babies come from and how they can prevent pregnancy, the better off they will be. Of course, it's possible you were taught incorrectly too, so you'll want to refresh your memory before educating your teen.  Educating yourself might also make you more comfortable about the subject, especially if you're from a very conservative background. You can find information on sex from books in your local library, at a doctor's office, and even on the internet. When kids don’t get educated about sex, they’ll try to make their best guess about how stuff works. Often, those guesses are horribly, hilariously wrong. Now, as funny as some of these ideas can be (“You can get pregnant from kissing!”), sometimes misinformation can lead to your teen getting pregnant or getting someone else pregnant. You’ll want to make sure that any misconceptions they have are thoroughly dealt with so that they can make good choices for themselves.  You can find examples of pregnancy myths in the section of this article for teens. The best way to find out what bad ideas your teen has about sex is to talk to them about what they know. Ask them: “What do you know about sex? How does a woman get pregnant? What role does a man play? How do you think pregnancy can be prevented?” Even with open communication and a good relationship between the two of you, your teen might still feel uncomfortable about asking for what they need when it comes to preventing pregnancy. You can eliminate this concern by making sure that they can access birth control without having to ask you directly.  One option would be to teach them where to go to get birth control on their own and at low cost, such as by making their own doctor’s appointment. Another option would be to let them know that you’ll keep a fresh box of condoms at the back of the drawer in the bathroom. They can take condoms without having to ask and you will replace them if the box runs out. Now, no one’s advocating here that you just run into this 100% liberal and promoting sex to your teen as if there are no consequences. It’s important for you to talk to your teen about what you worry about and how sex can go wrong. If you communicate your concerns in a healthy, non-judgmental way, you’ll actually e more likely to convince them that they might want to wait. Talk to them about:  The health risks The emotional risks, and The risks to their future Drugs and alcohol are also a nearly unavoidable part of growing up. While your teen might normally make very good choices, it only takes one night of bad choices to wind up with a pregnant teen. Head this off at the pass by letting them know that if they’re going to do those things, they need to at least do them in a safe environment. Tell them that impaired judgement can lead to poor decisions about sex or no ability at all to even make the choice. Girls should be warned about what boys might do to them if they pass out and boys should be warned about how getting consent is crucial to having sex but that alcohol can make you forget that. If your teen has goals and hopes for the future, they’ll have much more incentive to stay away from sex or at least be responsible about the sex that they do have. Help them pursue their dreams in order to keep them busy and make their goals seem reachable. Encourage them and help them believe that they can be more than they are now. If your teen’s day is packed with activities, they’ll have less time and energy with which they can get themselves into trouble. Don’t expect that this will make them abstain from dating and physical intimacy altogether but it should remove some of the opportunities and certainly keep them from having sex just because they’re bored.  Get them signed up for clubs or extra classes which let them engage in their interests and hobbies. If their hobby is something that they can do at home, invest it getting them some tools so that they can fully immerse themselves in that activity. If you don’t have the money to pay for them to take an extra class in their favorite subject, talk to your local community center or community college. There may be grants or special tuition available to help your teen pursue these activities. At the end of the day, you can’t control the choices that your teen makes: you’re simply not driving the car that is their life. But if you need to, you can direct their path by limiting the roads they can take. Pay attention to what they’re doing. If they’re dating someone much older (for girls) or much younger (for guys), do what you can to make sure that they make good choices. You should also talk to them if their dating relationships seem to be very “serious”. If your teens are going out a lot to parties, it might be time to reign in their behavior. While these situations aren’t always easy to control, doing something is better than doing nothing.\n",
            "   4  Check out their ring finger on their left hand. Is there a wedding ring? If so, you’ll need to decide if that is an obstacle that will deter you from pursuing them. If there is no ring, try to determine if they have a significant other. Some professors may casually mention their boyfriend, girlfriend, or fiancé in class. Listen up, and see if they throw out any hints. You can also ask current or former students if they’ve heard anything about their relationship status. If you can locate them on Facebook, that’s a great way to figure out if they’re available or taken.  If you can’t determine their relationship status from afar, be bold. After class, walk up to your professor and say something like, “Hi, Professor! I think I saw you and your [girlfriend or boyfriend] at a restaurant last weekend. Was that you?” Hopefully, bluffing will get you some information. If you’re lucky, they’ll give away some valuable clues in their answer. Don’t make assumptions about their sexual orientation. If you’ve determined they are single, try to ask around to make sure they’re even interested in your gender! However, even if your teacher is believed to be straight, remember they can also be bisexual, or their sexual orientation may not be known on campus. Some universities ban them completely, while others only strongly discourage them. This information may not make a difference to you, but it can help you determine how difficult it might be to convince your professor. Your relationship may be technically permissible, and therefore it may not take much convincing at all.  If it’s forbidden, the challenge (and the scandal) may simply make the relationship more exciting. If you signed up for a random class solely in hopes of seducing the professor, you may not have much to lose. However, if your professor is also head of the department for your major, you should probably consider outcomes before diving in headfirst. When it comes to matters of the heart, though, sometimes you have to throw logic out the window.  If the professor rejects you, will you be OK? If you know you have to take three more courses with them to get your major, tread carefully. Classes can be even more difficult if you have a strained relationship with your professor. If you successfully seduce them, could a relationship negatively affect your academic future?\n",
            "   5  Most curtain rods come with brackets that must be fastened to the wall so the rod can sit in them. Measure up 4 inches (10 cm) and out 1 to 3 inches (25 to 76 mm) on each side to find where your brackets should be placed, and mark it with a pencil. Hold the brackets in place and mark where the holes for the screws are on the wall. You can also trace around the edge of the bracket for further reference. Once you have determined the placement of each bracket, take a long ruler or board and hold it up between the two marks. Place a level on top of the ruler to check if the two placements are even with each other. If you find that they are not even, measure and mark again. Many curtain rods will come with hollow plastic pegs called wall anchors that can be driven into your wall to hold the screw. This helps keep the weight of the curtain from damaging the wall.  Drill or nail a pilot hole in the place where the wall anchor will go. Make sure the hole is not larger than the anchor itself.  Use a hammer to gently tap the anchor into the pilot hole. Once you have inserted the wall anchors, hold the brackets in place so that their holes line up with the wall anchors. Then use a drill to fasten the brackets to the wall with screws. If your curtain rod did not come with screws, make sure you use screws that are the same size as the wall anchors. Your curtain most likely has either holes, rings, or a hem that the curtain rod can be slipped through. If it has rings, make sure all the rings are lined up in the same direction and not twisted. You may need to use a stepladder or chair to reach the brackets. Most rods rest on top of the brackets, although some may be inserted from the side, which will require collapsing and extending the rod to fit it between the brackets.\n",
            "   6  . Nothing will get your interview off to a bad start faster than arriving late. Ideally, you should try to arrive 10-15 minutes early. This should give you enough time so that you don't have to stress if you hit a few red lights. If you don't know where you're going, consider traveling to the interview location a few days before the interview, just to get yourself familiar with the route. This is especially important if you're not sure about where you will be able to park. It's important to look professional for your interview. You want to look like someone who the parents can trust to take great care of their children.  Don't wear anything too revealing. Make sure you wear something that would be appropriate for a day on the job. If you show up wearing shoes that you can barely walk in, the parents might think that you don't understand the physical requirements of being a nanny. The more prepared you are for your interview, the more professional you will appear. If you think you might need it, then go ahead and bring it. In general, you should bring the following items to your interview:  Several copies of your  resume. Contact information for references, as well as letters of recommendation, if you have them Certificates from any relevant programs, including college degrees, first aid certificates, and CPR training certificates Photo identification A pen and paper to take notes A copy of your schedule (if you have other commitments) A list of questions you want to ask the family If the children are present during the interview, you have a great opportunity to showcase your skills. Take advantage of this opportunity to get to know the children and get them to like you.  Demonstrate that you know how to interact with children by getting down on their level, making eye contact with them, not interrupting them, asking them questions about what they have to say, and using encouraging language.  Ask the children questions about their interests and try to suggest activities that would be interesting for them. This is a good opportunity to talk about activities you like that may fit their interests. It may be a good idea to bring along some puzzles or games to share with the children during your interview. In some cases, the parents may ask you to do a trial shift, which will give you an opportunity to spend some time with the children, and will give them the opportunity to judge your performance. If you are asked to do this, it is especially important that you come prepared with as many engaging activities as possible to entertain the children. All job interviews are stressful, and nanny interviews can be especially unpredictable because the parents are probably not used to interviewing and may not know what to ask you. Despite all of the pressure, however, it's important to be yourself. After all, the parents are going to want to hire someone who is likable and genuine.  Be conscious of your body language. Lots of people fidget when they are feeling nervous. Try your best to sit still, have good posture, and keep smiling. This will make you appear much more confident. Maintaining eye contact with your interviewer and having a strong handshake are also very important.\n",
            "   7  If you already have curtains and just want to make them darker, you can purchase blackout liners instead of full curtains. These typically clip on to the inside of the curtains, or have holes that allow them to attach to your current curtain rings. Make sure to get accurate measurements of your existing curtains before you buy liners. If you want a room to be as dark as possible at night but still sunny during the day, you may want to buy a blackout roller shade instead of curtains. These shades are usually installed without a rod and can be easily rolled up when not in use. You can hang sheer curtains on the same window to use during the day. If you want to block as much light as possible, make sure the curtains you buy are 100% blackout. If you just want to make a room slightly darker, however, you may prefer to use a lower percentage. Even light-colored curtains that are labeled as 100% blackout will not block light as well as dark-colored ones. Black curtains, or dark blue, grey, or brown, are ideal. Blackout curtains tend to be heavier than regular curtains. Look at the curtain rods you currently have, and if they are very thin or bow slightly when you tug on the curtains, you may want to replace them with something sturdier. If you are installing a new curtain rod with your blackout curtains, look for a return rod, or a wraparound rod. These rods have smooth corners on the ends that allow the curtain to slide all the way to the wall, which will prevent light from entering at the sides. Some fabric companies sell blackout curtain material by the yard. You can also just use a heavy material like velvet or wool, but it won’t be as effective. Buy enough fabric to fit the measurements you took and hem the edges.  To hang the curtain on your rod, make another hem along the top of the curtains that is large enough to slide the rod through. If you don’t like the look of the blackout fabric, you can buy another material as well and use this as the outside of the curtain.\n",
            "   8  Your cat will now need to care for her kittens. Nursing kittens will require that your cat has access to more food, sometimes as much as double, and continue wth a high protein/calcium diet. Continue to feed your cat a high protein kitten food and always provide access to clean water. The mother should use her body heat to keep the kittens warm. However, you'll also want to make sure her environment makes this as easy as possible. Keep warm blankets near her and the room temperature high.  If the mother is being inattentive to the kittens, you can provide a heating pad on low to help keep the babies warm. Make sure the kittens and mom remain in a calm place where she will not feel threatened. This can cause a danger to the kittens and the mom. Your cat still may have problems after the birthing process is done. If you notice vaginal bleeding, or a prolapsed uterus (a uterus pushed out through the vagina), you should consult your vet. Also look for:  Look out for atypical behavior, such as ignoring the kittens. She may reject the kittens, or if she feels in enough danger, she may even kill the litter. Keep an eye out for inflamed mammary glands. Infected glands will become enlarged, hot to the touch, and may even appear a different color. Watch for changes in appetite. If your cat is not getting enough nutrients this can endanger both her and the kittens. If an extended period goes by and your cat is unwilling to eat, take her to a vet.\n",
            "   9  Though seeds are a very common diet for parakeets in the wild, they are also a source of bacterial infection and can easily lower the health and lifespan of your bird. Bacteria can build up and overwhelm your bird over time. Consider converting your parakeet’s diet to roughly 60-70% pellets. Birds adapt to pellets at various rates, and initially may reject them, perhaps vigorously. However, about 90% of parakeets will convert within two weeks using the following plan:  Give birds seed for only one hour in the morning and one hour at night. The rest of the time they have to snack on pellets. Generally, the 10% of parakeets that don't switch in two weeks will switch after a short period of reverting to a seed diet. As well as the seeds, feed a variety of fresh fruit and vegetables such as kale, beets, peas, carrots, parsley, cooked yams, sliced apple, mandarin oranges, citrus, and the like. If you vary what you offer the bird—never give the same fresh food two days in a row—this avoids any dietary overloads that might be associated by feeding an excessive amount of one food.  Try clipping pieces of apple or carrot to the bars at which your bird can peck. For larger fruits and veggies, you can also chop them up in a food processor to food in your bird’s food bowl. Most fresh foods are safe for parakeets EXCEPT for avocados, eggplants, apple pips, rhubarb, tomato plant leaves, and potato plant leaves. You should also never give your parakeet caffeine, chocolate, or alcohol. Let the bird get used to you and the surroundings, doing nothing but maintaining his food/water and cage, before trying to train the bird to perch on your finger. Millet sprigs or \"sprays\" are a favorite treat but don't feed too much of it (about 1/2\" per day), as it is fattening like junk food. Avoid sweets or excess oats, both of which are fattening. Millet sprays are also one of the best ways to train the parakeet to perch on your finger. Parakeets need company so be prepared to spend at least ninety minutes a day—though not necessarily all at once—chatting to your bird or interacting. Parakeets can be clicker trained as well, which is a fun way of stimulating the bird mentally and encouraging her to bond with you.  Without regular and sufficient attention, parakeets will lose interest in human interaction. A pair will tend to bond with one another (regardless of sex) and ignore humans, but through interaction, you can be considered part of the flock. A way to interact with your bird is to sing together, give it baths and if it seems to be rapidly dropping a mobile toy, pick it up. There is a chance it is trying to play a game with you. Sometimes parakeets get lonely. A good way to get them happy again is to talk to them. To get them to climb up on your finger, push a little bit on their stomach, and say, \"Step up.\" By continuously saying that, they will start to say it by themselves, and will \"step up\" whenever they say it, which will usually be when they come to a stair/ledge. Although the bird can fly in the cage, it is a good idea to let the bird out once a day for free flight. Obviously, be alert for hazards and close windows and doors, extinguish candles, and that sort of thing. Again, clicker training can come in handy to test your bird a command when it’s time to return to the cage. Many things you might not immediately consider can be dangerous to parakeets. Before allowing your bird out of the cage, remember not just to close windows, but also: put away potentially dangerous shiny objects such as knives in the kitchen, turn off all fans, keep them off the floor around children and other pets, etc. The safer you can make the environment, the better. Parakeets will sleep approximately ten hours a day, mostly at night, but they can nap during the day as well. When your parakeet is asleep, try not to make too much noise, though music or the television at low volumes is still okay. At night, parakeets like the security of being covered, so drape a towel or pillowcase over the cage. Parakeets are sensitive to large swings in temperature. They do well with average household temperatures, but always make sure their cage has a shady spot where they can retreat and try not to let indoor temperatures exceed 80°F (27°C). Do not place the cage in direct sunlight. Parakeets are a lot of work, but you will find them an affectionate and funny companion. Most will talk and how much they learn is really up to you. Be prepared to do some daily care and maintenance, as well as giving them attention and playtime, or consider getting another hobby.\n",
            "  10  You, of course, know that smoking is detrimental to your health, from causing lung cancer to heart disease. You may not know that smoking can also lead to neck pain. If you have chronic neck pain, consider putting the cigarettes down.  One way to help yourself quit is to tell your friends and family that you want to quit. They can help stop you when you start to light up without thinking. Telling them can also help them be more understanding with you while you're trying to quit. Try a medication. Nicotine patches or gum help many people to quit smoking. Bifocals and trifocals can be very convenient. However, they can also put strain on your neck if you're leaning your head back to use them. A better option is switching to reading glasses when you need them so that you have your full range of vision. In addition, make sure to visit your eye doctor at least once a year to check up on your prescription. Otherwise, you may find yourself leaning over to read because your prescription is not current. If you are constantly holding your neck in a certain position, it can be strain on your neck. Therefore, it's important to take breaks to move around and stretch your neck, shoulders, and back. Try to take a break at least once an hour.\n",
            "  11  It may not be appropriate to brush kittens if they are too heavily soiled – wash first, then brush. However, if your kitten isn't very dirty and the fur doesn't seem contaminated, you can easily clean her by brushing.  Brushing is very helpful to remove any fleas from wild rescued kittens. It also helps to stimulate subcutaneous blood circulation, and it may actually improve the condition of your cat's skin. Brushing is especially important for long-haired cats. With long fur, it's much easier to get things stuck, smeared, and generally dirty. The brush or comb will differ from kitten to kitten based on the length and pattern of her coat. Check your kitten for fleas: if she is flea-ridden, you will need a special thin-toothed comb to remove the pests from the skin. You can purchase specially designed metal combs from most pet shops. Consult with your local vet if you are confused about which brush to select. Brushing in the wrong direction can irritate your kitten and cause her to lose hair. Brush her whole body thoroughly, focusing on the abdomen, back, and hindquarters.  Some kittens may resist brushing. Be gentle, and do not force. Use a calm, soothing voice when you're grooming your kitten, and try to make her feel comfortable. Clean your brush periodically during the process. Dirt and hair may clump on the bristles, making the tool less effective. Cats naturally groom themselves, and your kitten may take offense when you try to help her. She also may just be curious. If she begins biting at the brush, simply lay it in front of her so she can smell it, then use the second brush to keep brushing. This gives the kitten a chance to see the brush while she is being groomed. Eventually, she may learn to love brushing, and she may allow you to groom her freely Repeat as needed. Keep switching out the brushes. Whenever she grabs the brush you are using, just pick up the other one and continue to brush.\n",
            "  12  Going straight into a movie on a first date can be awkward. You want some time to talk and get comfortable with one another before sitting in a theater in silence. Plan to grab a quick cup of coffee or a drink before the film. Look for a place near the theater so you don't risk being late for a movie. Some people really dislike being late for movies. To avoid irking your date with tardiness, keep track of time. Make sure you and your date head to the theater so you'll have plenty of time to grab tickets, snacks, and get a good seat.  Aim to be at the theater around 15-20 minutes before the film starts. You can also try buying tickets online to avoid lines at the theater. Some people enjoy getting seated as early as possible so they don't miss trailers. If you initiated the date, offering to pay is a nice gesture. However, some people are uncomfortable having their date pay for them. While you can offer to pay for the tickets, don't push it if your date would prefer to pay for their own seat. For example, say something like, \"I can get your ticket if you want.\" Pay attention to your date's body language. If they seem to be leaning towards you and placing their hand on the shared arm rest, this could be an indicator they would be open to holding hands during the film. If they move their hand away, don't chase it.    {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Have-a-Successful-First-Date-at-the-Movies-%28Guys%29-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Have-a-Successful-First-Date-at-the-Movies-%28Guys%29-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/4\\/4b\\/Have-a-Successful-First-Date-at-the-Movies-%28Guys%29-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\\/aid91178-v4-728px-Have-a-Successful-First-Date-at-the-Movies-%28Guys%29-Step-9-Version-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":\"728\",\"bigHeight\":\"546\",\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Some people enjoy casually whispering during a film while others prefer to stay silent.

            "  13  Obviously, it takes the participation of a male dog to get her pregnant. Think whether she has mated with a male dog, or whether it's possible that she escaped and found one to mate with. Castrated or neutered male dogs can mate with a female but cannot produce sperm to impregnate her. Entire (unneutered) male dogs, however, can impregnate her. If possible, contact the dog's owners to confirm. The exception is a dog who was castrated in the recent past–less than four weeks before the mating. There is a theoretical risk that he could have sperm retained in his tubes, which he ejaculates during the mating. This risk is small, but cannot be completely ruled out. This can give you vital information about whether it's possible she is pregnant. If the event happened three months ago, then she cannot be pregnant. This is because the average gestation (length of pregnancy) is 62 to 65 days (with a range from 57 to 72 days). If she had got pregnant then, by 90 days she would have given birth already. This can help your vet decide which is the best test to detect pregnancy. Pregnancy diagnosis methods depend on detecting hormonal changes, physical changes, or identifying embryos in the womb. Which test is the most likely to give a definitive answer depends on the number of days that have passed since mating. If a bitch was mated and the heat has not yet finished, it is too early to know if she is pregnant.\n",
            "  14  A bad boy knows what he wants from a partner and is honest about it (see step six under Part One.) There's no shame in pursuing purely sexual relationships as long as you're honest about it. Similarly, having a long-term girlfriend doesn't mean you have to be less of a bad boy. Below are some tips for handling the fairer sex like a true bad boy. The goal of a relationship shouldn't be to dedicate your life to your partner. Even if you're married, make your own plans. Reserve time for yourself. Spend time with your friends. If you treat yourself like a valuable commodity, your time will be highly sought-after by your partner. Conversely, if you're constantly making yourself available to your partner's whims, your time will become less valuable. Keep your backbone in any relationship - make sure you're not so dedicated to your partner that you forget about yourself. Being in a relationship with someone doesn't mean you need to worship them. Tease them! A lighthearted back-and-forth keeps a relationship passionate and fiery. It's also a good sign of a confident \"alpha\" personality - you're showing you're not afraid to engage in a little verbal swordplay. Think about it - would you really want to be in a relationship with someone you  always  have to be nice to?  Don't be too cruel with your teasing. Avoid subjects that your partner is sensitive about - for instance, her looks or her career. Keep it light. Be prepared to receive some teasing yourself - don't dish it out if you can't take it! If you accidentally hurt your partner's feelings, make a genuine apology. Remember, bad boys are honest - if you're truly sorry, say so. Don't feel like you need to withhold a well-deserved apology to be a bad boy. That's not \"bad\" - it's just jerkish. This doesn't mean to boss your partner around or prevent her from making decisions. Rather, it means you should aim to be decisive in situations where it's appropriate and to have a plan at all times. For instance, if you're going out, pick a place and make reservations ahead of time. Take her hand to lead her through crowds without being asked. Kiss her when the mood suits you. Show her that you're confident about what you want for yourself and her.    Choose a topic of conversation that you're passionate about. Talk your family, or an event that strikes home for you. Don't gossip; speak from the heart, and let your darling know that you have a sensitive side and show her your true family man side. In a long-term relationship, it can be difficult not to fall into certain habits and routines. Still, make an effort to be spontaneous sometimes. Plan weekend getaways when you both have the time. Surprise her with tickets to an evening concert when she wakes up in the morning. Breaking the routine of a relationship keeps it fresh and exciting.  It might seem paradoxical to plan seemingly \"spontaneous\" activities ahead of time. However, it's necessary - nothing's worse than making an impromptu trip to an ice-skating rink only to discover that it's closed. Skating rinks aren't very bad boy anyway. Remember that the goal of being spontaneous is not to shower her with gifts. Maintain your personal value - if you're unsure of what to do, try to plan activities that  you  like. You'll be happy to go, and your happiness will reflect in your partner. Bad boys and their partners aren't dependent on each other. They maintain their own lives, friendships, and hobbies. This makes the time that they  do  spend together more valuable. Balancing time between your friends and your partner can be difficult. Luckily, since this is a common problem, it's been the source of much thoughtful (and some thoughtless) online writing. Consider consulting a sensibly-written article for advice.\n",
            "  15  Snap can be played with as few as two players and up to six (or even more). The game does become a bit hard to control when there are more than six players. It will require a second deck of cards for playing when you go above six players. The deck does not have to be completely full, because what matters are the ranks of the cards and not their suits. Some people choose to play Snap with decks from other card games, such as Old Maid, as long as the backs of the cards are all the same. Before beginning to pass out cards, the dealer must carefully and thoroughly shuffle the deck. Starting with the person to the left of the dealer, each person is given one card at a time, and it needs to be face-down.  The dealer continues to pass out the cards face-down in piles in front of each player until the last card is dealt. No players should look at their cards while they are being dealt. The first person picks up the card at the top of his/her face-down pile. The card must be turned over very quickly so that he/she cannot see it before anyone else. Then, the card is laid down face-up in a new pile next to the face-down pile. It is recommended to flip the card over in such a way that the face is away from the player. This way, if the card is flipped too slowly, then the player will be the last person to see it. At the end of the round, each person should have one card face-up next to his/her larger pile of face-down cards. This game requires the skill of paying attention to what is going on around you, as well as to what you are doing. The first person to notice that two cards with the same rank (i.e. 6, King, 2, et cetera) are face-up yells “Snap!”  Remember that the suit does not matter. The person who calls “Snap!” does not have to be one of the players with the matching cards, although you can play a variation with the rule that it does have to be one of those players. The player who successfully calls “Snap!” first gets to take both piles of face-up cards and add them to the bottom his/her own face-down card pile. The game should immediately continue after the two matching piles have been collected. The players who lose their face-up piles will start new ones from their remaining face-down pile. This means that they are closer to being out, unless they win piles by calling “Snap!” When this happens, take the two matching piles and combine them into one pile in the middle of the table. This is the snap pool. Play will resume, and when someone draws a card that matches the top card of the snap pool pile, the first player to yell “Snap pool!” first wins the middle pile. ” When a player calls “Snap!” at the wrong time, his/her face-up pile becomes a snap pool. Play is the same as in Step 10. Players must continue playing with the cards they have left if they lose their piles. Pick up your face-up pile of cards, turn it face-down without shuffling, and continue play. Eventually, as the game gets closer to the end, players with strong memories can memorize the order of their cards so that they can spend more time looking at their opponent's piles to call “Snap!” When a player is completely out of cards, he/she is out of the game. The winner of the game is the player who wins all of the cards.\n"

        "   1  Be the first to arrive at the site to oversee the preparations. Make sure everyone files in accordingly and start making phone calls if not. Assist those who need assisting, direct those who need directed, and get out of the way when you need to. No injuries until after the event, please.  You'll feel a little calmer if you make a checklist. Have a portion for your crew, a portion for hired out crews, a portion for decorations and basic set-up, and a portion for equipment. When all is checked off, that's when you have time to breathe. Do not be afraid to delegate. The main stressor when it comes to an event is time. To save it, all hands need to be on deck -- or different decks. If someone isn't being as useful as they could be, give them something better to do. It's your job. It's not you being bossy or overstepping your boundaries; it's you doing what you're supposed to do.  When you delegate, be firm but polite. Say, \"Juan, I need you over here right now to help out with the caterers. Thank you.\" Your crew needs to jive together as much as the event does. Keep everything moving swimmingly by being the leader that you need to be. This means making sure that things are kept to schedule and assisting or having backup plans if it falls behind -- and being okay with it. If you start stressing out, you'll lose your head. Nothing good will come of that. So when that speech runs ten minutes over and the speaker is ignoring your blatant distress signals or your attempt at feigning a stroke to create a diversion, relax. You'll just adjust the appetizer and no one will notice. Event intact. Things happen. They do. They have a bad habit of happening. There's no way you can predict everything, and the sooner you accept this the better. A calm, collected event manager can do wonders for any event; a strung-out, tense one cannot. So relax and go with the flow -- it'll all be over soon! Check that guest numbers and needs are still correct on the day of the event and advise the service team of any changes at the earliest possible opportunity You should be the first set of eyes that notices if anything goes wrong.  Consult with your clients to see how they are feeling; they may be excited, nervous, worried, bored or mentally drained or have some issue on their plate that in some cases you may soothe with understanding, some kind words and practical assistance. It is wise to use this time to rejuvenate the enthusiasm in guests and the team where appropriate. Trust and respect your service team to look after themselves -- if you've given them a good base, they should be fine. Offer assistance if needed, but they should be experienced enough not to need any help at all. Here are a few things to keep in mind:   Act as a concierge or receptionist at the beginning, meeting and greeting each guest (if appropriate) as they come. Hand over the reins to the MC when the event starts. The management role will be more active problem solving and ensuring all the back of housework such as food preparation and service runs to plan. Keep an eye on the guests and keep contact with the MC often and discreetly in case they want (or need) to change plans. Keep a respectful distance from the key guests - after all, the event is all about them - but be easily accessible by checking at appropriate moments how they feel the event is going, as well as any problems, requests or suggestions they may have. You want all your guests to remember how awesome of a time they had. Actually, you probably want more than that. A visit to a website, future donations, word of mouth buzz, whatever. To ensure that your event is the legend it deserves to be, give a takeaway. Whether it's a picture, a flyer, or a pen, having something to remind your guests of the event is a good way to make sure you stay in their minds. Most events tend to run themselves when they start, but all the hard work is the preparation that no-one sees. So pat yourself on the back because you deserve it! Okay, back to tearing it down. The job's not over yet!  After the event, arrange a time to meet and thank your client. It is always recommended to offer an appropriate and thoughtful gift to remember their time with you, as it is these small touches that make the experience richer and may make them recommend your services in future. If you gave a gift during the event, such as in a gift registry with the other guests, then a thoughtful after present such as flowers, a framed photograph of your favourite moment at their event (such as cutting the ribbon, or the climax of the show, or the award ceremony, or the wedding kiss, or blowing out the candles on a cake, etc), or some other gift may be appropriate. Just like mom said, \"Leave it in the same condition you found it in,\" the same goes for your venue. Everything needs to be just like it was before you got there -- this is one business where you don't want to burn any bridges. So let your crews know it's time to tear down and don't let them leave until all is taken care of. And you need to pitch in too!  This is nice, sure, but it also prevents you from being billed any more than you should be. Many places will tack on extra cleaning fees if they find any opportunity to do so. So make it as spic and span as possible to avoid the hidden costs. You may need to arrange returning hired or borrowed equipment and later on consulting with the client about their experience. Even if unpaid after the event, thank them for the opportunity to have such a great experience to run an event with them. Can you get a business card of theirs?  Thank your crew, too! Make sure all parties are paid (and all parties have paid up), file receipts, and get everyone taken care of. You should be one of the last ones out the door -- and make sure it's locked behind you.\n",
        "   2  Fermented dairy products contain both probiotics and prebiotics. Eat 1 serving of fermented dairy products per day. Fermented dairy products include plain yogurt, cottage cheese, kefir, whey, buttermilk, leben, and crème fraîche.  Look for yogurt products with the label “active cultures” on it. Choose natural yogurts over sweetened yogurts. Instead, sweeten your yogurt naturally with fruit like bananas, peaches, blueberries, and strawberries. Probiotics are microorganisms that stimulate the growth of gut flora. Prebiotics are the fibers that feed probiotics. Non-dairy fermented foods, or pickled foods, are a great alternative to fermented dairy products if you are lactose intolerant. Like fermented dairy products, pickled foods contain probiotics. Eating pickled foods consistently will help you restore your gut flora. Non-dairy fermented foods include sauerkraut, kimchi, corn relish, miso, tempeh, natto, fermented tofu, and pickled vegetables like cucumbers, beets, cabbage, and radish. Taking a probiotic supplement is another great way to restore your gut flora. Take the supplement per the instructions on the bottle. If you are already eating fermented foods to restore your gut flora, it is safe to take a probiotic supplement as well. However, you can take a supplement in place of eating fermented foods, if you do not like fermented food.  Contact your doctor if you are unsure how often you should take the supplement, or if you are taking other medications. If you are taking an antibiotic, a probiotic supplement may help restore your gut flora.  Probiotic supplements are formulated to treat many different conditions. If you have IBS, for instance, you might try using VSL#3. Talk to your doctor or your pharmacist about the ideal product for your specific symptoms.\n",
        "   3  A to-bring list of items can vary widely depending on the type of weekend trip you're planning. Certain things, like an extra set of clothes, are recommended across the board, while other things can be brought or left depending on the type of place you're going to. Here is a list of things to consider bringing:   Clothes. For a weekend trip, a fresh set of clothing should be considered necessary. You will want to feel fresh on the second and third day of being away from home, and in the case that your first set of clothes gets wet or dirty, you'll want something to fall back on. The same applies to socks and underwear. Bring heavier clothing, like a jacket, based on the forecasted weather.   Toiletries. Toothpaste and a toothbrush should be deemed essential for your trip. If the place you're going has running water, a small vial of shampoo and conditioner should be brought along as well to ensure you're feeling fresh throughout the trip.  Trip entertainment. The journey to and from your location should be just as enjoyable as when you get there. This can be helped by taking along some entertainment. If you're driving, bring a few of your favourite CDs to cycle through. A good book is also recommended, particularly if you're going somewhere relaxing like a lake.  Trip-applicable items. A weekend vacation is often built around a certain activity. Your to-bring list should mention the specific things you'll need to perform that activity. If you're fishing, for example, you will need a rod and a bait box, among other things. Depending on where you're going, items like some mild first aid should be considered as well. A weekend trip is relatively easy to outline. It's not a large amount of time, and it's usually focused on one specific activity. Try to gauge what you will need. Can you think of any activities you'll most likely be doing? What are you hoping to do over the weekend? Running through the vacation in your mind's eye will give you a stronger idea what you should be bringing along with you.  For example, if you're going to a lake in the Summer, useful items such as bug spray and lighter fluid are recommended. Imagine the possible scenarios that relate to the environment in question, and speculate as to the things you would need. If there are activities you may do but aren't sure about (like swimming, for example) it's best to bring them along anyway. A weekend trip isn't going to require much baggage to begin with, and you might feel left out if you decide not to bring something. Your packing should be arranged with respects to the weekend's activity and the environment it's taking place in. Because your trip will only encompass a couple of days, it's prudent to check the weather forecast for those days and plan accordingly. If there's going to be rain, the clothes you bring should reflect that. A poncho and umbrella will be sorely missed if you neglect to check the weather beforehand. In the case of sun, bringing sunglasses and sunscreen will be helpful. Cold weather demands you bring heavier clothing, like a winter parka, along for the ride. If you're somehow unsure, prepare for the worst just in case.  Even if your weekend trip will be spent mostly indoors, bringing an umbrella can make a major difference in the case of rain. Download an app like Weatherbug for on-the-go weather forecasts. Under the best circumstances, you won't need to use everything you bring with you on a weekend trip. In case something bad happens however, you don't want to be far from home and wishing you had brought something. This is especially true if you're going to be camping or otherwise hiking somewhere where help isn't immediately available.  Carry a small bit of first-aid along with your toiletries. This includes some band-aids, aloe vera and headache relievers. These will take up a negligible amount of space, and you'll be glad you brought them if it comes time to use them. A set of extra socks will come in handy, especially if the weather is forecasted to be rainy. Nothing spoils a good weekend faster than wet feet. Even if you're only going to be gone for a weekend, an extra set of underwear is never a bad idea. For a weekend trip, you're more likely to overpack than underpack. Unless you're going camping, you won't need much to hold you over for a weekend and carrying too much stuff around will sap some of the enjoyment of travel to begin with. If you can, see how much you can minimize the amount of stuff you bring, and try to stuff it all into a backpack. You don't want to skimp out on things you might miss, but optional luxuries like a hair dryer can probably be done without over a 48 hour period. For a weekend trip, try to limit yourself to a single backpack forth of clothing and items. This will force you to prioritize what you need over the things you can do without. One change of top is usually all you'll need for a weekend.\n",
        "   4  A bra that doesn't fit right will look \"off\" under your clothes. You may be spilling out of the cups or have a band that is too tight and looks lumpy, which may draw attention to your chest. A bra that provides proper support and fits correctly will help you feel comfortable and may improve your confidence.  Check that your bra straps don't dig into your shoulders. Your straps should not be working hard to support your breasts. You may need a smaller band size or a bra with wider straps. You can also buy padding that slips under your straps if your bra fits right but your straps still hurt. Make sure the bra band (the strap that runs across your back) is parallel to the ground or lower. The bra band should provide most of the support, and the lower it is on your back, the more support it can provide.  The cups should be smooth against your chest. If your breasts are spilling out the top or sides or it feels like your bra is cutting into your breasts, try a larger cup or a bra with a bigger cup design.  You should be able to fit a finger under the front of your bra band. If it's too tight, you need a larger band size.  A professional fitting can be extremely beneficial in helping you find a bra that fits correctly. An employee at a lingerie store or department store can measure you for the right band and cup size. The wrong bra can make your breasts look saggy but, even worse, can cause you significant pain. There are many different bra types on the market, and you'll need to find out which ones work for your body.  Try a multi-cup bra. The cups on these bras are made up of two or more pieces of fabric and they provide a ton of support. They will center your breast tissue, which will slenderize your silhouette.  Try a long-line bra, which can relieve stress on your shoulders and back. The band on this bra is extended down to your waist, which distributes the weight of your breasts more evenly over your body. It can also act as shape wear, giving you a smooth line under your clothes.  Try a minimizer bra, especially if you like button-up shirts. Minimizer bras minimize your breasts' projection, or how far they stick out. If you find your breasts cause gaps between the buttons in your shirts, a minimizer will push them back. Be aware that this can also create cleavage, which you may want to avoid if you're trying to deflect attention from your breasts. If you find that the stores in your area don't have bras that accommodate women with larger breasts, there are plenty of great online retailers that offer attractive bras that will give you the support you need. Keep in mind that if you are above a DD cup, sizing will vary among different companies. Check the sizing on the website to make sure you choose the right bra.\n",
        "   5  That is, if you're breaking up with a partner or letting go of a toxic friend, it's best to get your own feelings out of the way first. Take time to write a healing letter and list all your complaints and hurt feelings. Use this letter to vent everything, and then you can move on to writing a letter for your friend or partner. The first letter tends to be emotionally charged. You may want to blame the other person for everything or hurl insults. But getting it out of the way is good because then you can move on to a calmer, more rational letter. Spend at least part of the letter talking about what you like about the person and your relationship together. In most relationships, there are good times as well as bad, and no matter why you're saying goodbye, you can still end on a good note by taking time to think about what was good. You could write about good memories, like how you met or when you fell in love. Even though you're saying goodbye to the person, you can still note what you liked about the person in the past. You don't need to trash the person to move on, and if you really feel the need to, then maybe that's a letter you should keep to yourself instead. For example, you could say, \"I love your kind spirit, your willingness to go on adventures, and your compassion for everyone you met. You made me want to be a better person, and for that, I will always be grateful.\" If you're breaking up, you both likely played some part in how ended. Don't hold back. Apologize for any part you played in what happened, and if you can, offer forgiveness to the other person. That way, you don't part with bad blood between you. For example, you might write, \"I'm sorry for how things have ended between us, and I apologize for my part in that. I don't hold any grudges against you, and I hope you won't hold any against me.\" If this person was special to you, you can make note of that at the end. Discuss how you'll still think about the person in the future, for instance, and how you'll remember the good times fondly, despite the fact that you need to go your separate ways. For instance, you might say, \"I'm sorry that we have to go our separate ways, but I think we just don't work together anymore. No matter what, you will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n",
        "   6  Hold the diaper firmly as you move it around and place it properly. Lay the dry diaper temporarily on the child’s waist so that you can obtain the new pins or get ready to fix the new diaper up again. The amount of diaper you flare back out at the bottom will depend on the child’s weight and width of their waistline. Only flare out and work with one side of the child's diaper at a time. You can repeat this for the other side later. Grab any two pins that aren't in use yet and secure the diaper, reversing the pin's removal from the preparatory steps above. Insert the pin into the diaper and close the pin. Do not push each pin through all the layers of the inner diaper, so you don't risk sticking yourself and your baby. Be sure to insert the end of the pins  away  from the child’s navel/belly button. Snap the diaper pins closed from both sides. Diaper pins are created with an open section in the pin-head. Push the pin around and into the head of the pin’s opening, and push inwards so the pin-head is covering this end of the pin.\n",
        "   7  Rub a dry bar of soap over your nail holes, back and forth. Stop once the holes look filled in. Run a dry cloth or rag over the surface of the holes to wipe excess soap pieces away.  Avoid using a wet or damp rag, which can melt or dissolve the soap. Opt for a white soap if you have white walls. You can use this method for either drywall or plaster walls.\n",
        "   8  Measure the width at the bottom of the shower opening. Transfer that measurement to the bottom shower door track and mark with your marking pen. If the track fits to size, move forward with installation. If it's too long, you'll need to cut it to the appropriate length. Using a hacksaw, carefully cut the rail at the mark you made. Be sure the rail is held firmly as you cut to avoid damage to the rail or the saw. Use a file to remove the burrs from all metal pieces you cut. Before you go attaching the tracks on forever, you need to place them temporarily and mark where they need to go. Place the bottom track along the base of the shower opening with the higher lip of the track facing outward. Make sure the track sits flat along the surface. There should be about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of play at each end.  Temporarily tack the bottom track into place with masking tape, then mark the position with your marking pen along the inner and outer edges. Do not remove the bottom track yet. The wall tracks should be pre-cut to size from the factory. Slide the wall tracks into position with the bottom track. Make sure the wall tracks fit the bottom track exactly. Use your level to check for plumb. Holding each track firmly, use your marking pen to mark the mounting hole locations on each wall then set the wall tracks aside. With a nail or a center punch, tap a small dimple into the marks you made for the holes in the wall tracks to use as a pilot hole. This prevents your drill bit from “skating” and damaging the surface. Drill your mounting holes using the proper bit for the surface of your shower. If you are drilling into tile, put a small piece of masking tape over each spot to be drilled. This will help prevent chipping. Also, drill deep enough so the plastic screw anchors will fit properly. Anchors won't be needed on fiberglass. Run a bead of caulk, about the thickness of a bead of toothpaste, along the bottom mounting surface. Center the bead between the two lines you marked when you measured and run it the full length of the gap as well. Then, firmly set the bottom track into place over the bead of caulk.  Make sure the underside of the track makes contact with the caulking. If not, run a separate bead along the center of the underside of the track. Hold the track in place for a minute or two, taping it down to hold it in place if necessary. It should be try in five minutes at the most, then you can move forward knowing that it's secure. Line them up with the mounting holes and make sure they fit properly over the ends of the bottom track. If you've measured correctly and marked correctly, they should snap right into place. If your kit included them, place the rubber bumpers that come with most door kits over the screws and secure the tracks to the wall by using your screwdriver to turn the screws into place. Do not completely tighten the screws at this point, hand tight is sufficient. Swinging doors will need to be installed differently, according to the kit that you've purchased, so it's important to read the instructions that come with it and follow the directions accordingly. The door needs to be installed so it pivots outward, but for some kits that'll be on the left side and for some that'll be on the right side, and the mechanism works differently, depending. With some, the door will just snap into place, while screws will be used for other kits. In most swinging door kits, a strip of rubber will be slid into the wall track opposite the pivot point, held with screws in some cases. If you had to cut the threshold track, you'll likely also have to cut the top track, since it'll be roughly the same length. Make sure the track fits snugly, connecting between the two wall tracks, and is properly aligned between them. It should just snap right on top. Many door kits will have corner brackets that are attached with screws to hold the top rail securely. Defer to the instructions of your specific kit, if necessary. Finally, run a bead of bathtub caulk along all the points at which the tracks come in contact with the walls. Do this to both inside and outside surfaces to create a neat, watertight seal. Let the caulk dry thoroughly and wait at least 24 hours before running water in the shower to test your work. It should be dry in a few minutes, but it's a good idea to wait and let things settle before you try it out.\n",
        "   9  Pick a paint that is suitable for metal, such as an enamel paint, an acrylic- or oil-based product, or another hard-drying paint. Most paints that are suitable for metal will be spray paints, but some may come in liquid (roll-on) form. Avoid latex paints for brass, as these don’t adhere as well to metal and aren't as durable. They may be usable if you have selected a high quality primer. The best primer for brass is a self-etching primer, also known as a bonding primer. This is a mixture of acid and zinc, and it will adhere better to the brass than any other type of paint or primer. Shake the primer well and hold it six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface of the metal. Spray in a sweeping motion, going from side to side, and apply a thin, even coat of primer onto the surface.  Let the primer dry for about 24 hours, or according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Wear all proper safety equipment when using spray paint, including gloves, safety glasses, and a mask. Even after scrubbing with steel wool, brass still doesn’t have a great surface for painting, which is why self-etching primer is important. Once the primer has had time to dry, apply the paint in the same way. Shake the can, use a sweeping side to side motion, and hold the can six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface to apply a thin, even coat.  Let each coat dry completely according to the manufacturer’s instructions (usually an hour or two) before applying a second or third coat.  Depending on the effect you're trying to achieve, you may need anywhere between two and five coats of paint. If your paint came in a liquid form, use a brush or roller to apply thin, even coats. Once the paint has had time to fully dry—usually about 24 hours—you can apply a clear top coat to finish the piece. This will help seal the piece, protect the paint, and make the finish shiny. Look for clear coats or enamel coats that are safe for metal.  Shake the can and hold it six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) from the surface. Spray the coat in a back and forth motion to apply an even coat on the metal. Set the piece aside to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions. These coats tend to dry quickly, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes.\n",
        "  10  As soon as you realize that you've accidentally come into contact with poison ivy, wash your skin very thoroughly. Use lots of warm, soapy water. If you can, wash within the first 30 minutes of touching the poison ivy. If you're still outdoors, find a stream or creek. Place the affected area in the running water for at least 10 minutes.  You should also wash underneath your fingernails. If you're washing up at home, wash all of your clothes and shoes or boots as well. A poison ivy rash can easily spread by simply scratching or touching. If you've come into contact with poison ivy or have a rash, do not touch anywhere around your eyes, mouth, or genitals. All parts of a poison ivy plant (even dead plants) contain an oily allergen called urushiol. This causes a rash or blisters if it comes into contact with your skin or you breathe it in. If you do get a rash around your eyes, mouth or genitals, you should see your doctor immediately. If you have blisters from the poison ivy, never break them open since this increases your risk of infection and scarring. Instead, soak your blisters in a bath with a solution of Burow's solution. You can buy a product containing this solution of aluminum sulfate and aluminum acetate at a drugstore or pharmacy. Soak the blisters for 20 minutes at least two or three times a day. Soaking in Burow's solution acts as an astringent which can reduce the size of the blisters and help dry them out. Fill a sock or nylon knee-high with steel-cut oatmeal. Tie the filled sock onto the tap of your bathtub. Run a cool bath so that the water runs through the oatmeal and into the tub. Soak in the oatmeal bath as long and as often as you like.  Studies have shown that oatmeal is great for soothing your rash and relieving itchiness. The less you scratch your rash, the sooner it will dry up.  You can also purchase an oatmeal bath product that you simply mix into your tub. Soak a clean cotton towel in cold water and squeeze out the extra water. Place the cold cloth over the rash for as long as it stays cool. When it warms up, simply run the cloth under cold water and wring it out again. You can do this as often as you like.  To make an astringent compress that dries out the rash, brew a pot of tea. Soak a clean towel in the cooled tea and apply it to your rash. When your body temperature is higher, your rash may seem itchier. Applying a cool compress can make the rash less itchy and soothe your skin.\n",
        "  11  Keep your hair natural and whimsical. Messy bohemian styles best capture the fairy look.  If you have long hair, wear it down or in braids. For those who prefer shorter hair, consider a pixie cut or a messy bob. Fairy-like details include piece-y (not perfectly even) bangs and tousled hair. Adorn your hair with ribbons and flowers. Antique pins and barrettes also make for a nice fairy look. Even out your complexion with a light-weight tinted moisturizer. If you are especially fair, apply a rosy blush to your cheeks. Apply a shimmering powder to your cheekbones. Use a highlighter pencil under your brow bone. Fairy beauty is fresh, glowy and wide-eyed.  Wear lip-gloss or a sheer lipstick. Look for products with shimmer. Avoid matte lipsticks, as these are too heavy.  Good color choices include pink, red and wine. Widen your eyes with mascara and light eye-shadow. Choose a good mascara and use only one coat to avoid heavy, spidery lashes. Look for light, shimmering shadows. Mocha, silver and moss-green are some good color options. Fairy fashion is feminine and ethereal, old-fashioned and romantic.  Wear long skirts and flowy dresses. Look for gossamer fabrics and filigree detailing. Err on the side of demure. In summer, you can show your arms, shoulders and perhaps some décolleté, but avoid hems that are too high (think thigh-high) and plunging necklines. For your winter wardrobe, check out the winter fashions of 19th-century Russia. The long coats, muffs and round hats capture the romantic fairy look. Accessorize with headbands and jewelry. Again, antique designs, beads, ribbons and flowers create a romantic and whimsical fairy look. Fairies are often barefoot, but this is not practical. Flat shoes, sandals and Mary Janes are excellent choices. Low-heeled shoes are acceptable, but exceedingly high, stiletto heels are not compatible with the free and easy fairy look.\n",
        "  12  For your parents to come over, you must be a permanent resident in the U.K. That means that you need to have citizenship, permanent leave to remain, permanent residency, refugee status, or humanitarian protection. Basically, if you are legally staying in the UK on a semi-permanent basis, you can likely bring your parents over. The main way you can bring over your parents is if they need assistance with daily care tasks, including household tasks, personal hygiene tasks, and/or medical tasks. Your parents must need this care because of illness, disability, or age.  Also, they must not be able to get this care where they are living right now, which includes not having any relatives there who can provide that support. Exceptions may be made if care is not affordable. Both parents must apply at the same time if they are both still alive and still married. In other words, if one parent could depend on the other for care, the UK government won't allow just the one parent who needs care to apply. Both parents must need care. In other words, you'll need to show you have sufficient income to provide continuing support for your relatives. You must not use public funds to provide this support.  Generally, you must prove you can at least meet the threshold of making 18,600 pounds per year, which is the amount where you are not dependent on the state for things like a housing credit or tax credits.  It can help to have money saved. If you need to, try creating a budget to help you put some money back.\n",
        "  13  Use caution when performing the pouring and cutting required in filling party balloons. Adults should supervise or perform parts of this process for children.  Use scissors carefully when cutting balloons. You can also avoid spills of the filling by laying down newspaper or another covering over your work area. Take care if you have a latex allergy, in which case you should opt for balloons made of Mylar or another material instead of the common latex. Adults should handle balloons for infants and toddlers, as balloons and balloon pieces are a choking hazard.\n",
        "  14  The percentage of alcohol and substance abuse is at its highest during college years. While a legal drink or two might be okay, know when you need to stop. Never take any substance and drive. No matter what situation you are in -- be it a party or walking around campus -- be alert to your surroundings. Watch for suspicious individuals or actions.  When walking around campus, always take well-walked routes and avoid walking around alone at night. Check out your campus safety's website. Often, campuses have emergency phones (they are often blue) scattered around campus for use. Almost half of college students reported feelings of depression or anxiety while in college. Check out your college campus resources for mental health.  Often, campuses offer free or cheap mental health care. Talk to a trusted person (advisor, professor, resident advisor) if you are feeling down. They can help point you to helpful resources.\n",
        "  15  If the server has done all in his or her power to serve the papers directly to the respondent and has been unable to do so, your server can hand those papers over to a party that can legally accept them on the respondent's behalf. A competent adult, age 18 or older, who lives at home with the respondent can usually accept the papers. Similarly, an adult who appears to be in charge at the respondent's workplace or an adult who seems to be in charge where the person receives mail can usually accept the papers, as well. When passing the court papers to a substitute, your server must leave that substitute with specific instructions regarding what the papers are and what needs to be done with them.  Make sure that the substitute knows that he or she is receiving court papers for a specific individual. The respondent must be named, and the substitute must be told to deliver the papers to the respondent. Get the substitute's name when you leave the papers. If the substitute refuses to provide a name, write down a thorough physical description of the substitute. When you serve papers by substitution, you must also mail another copy of all court papers by first-class mail. Address the package to the respondent.  You need to send the papers to the same address the server left the papers at. Afterward, the server must fill out the \"Proof of Service\" form as usual. In addition to this form, a \"Proof of Mailing (Substituted Service)\" form must also be filled out by the server.  Get both forms from the server after he or she fills them out. File them both together at the courthouse on or before your court date. Provide a postal receipt with your forms indicating that you sent a second copy of the papers through the mail.\n",

        "   0  Les adolescents qui harcèlent les autres le font en général parce qu'ils ont des problèmes dans leur propre vie. Malheureusement, ils ont des difficultés à gérer leurs propres problèmes, c'est pourquoi ils projettent leur tristesse sur vous. Cependant, il est important de savoir que le harcèlement n'a pas de rapport avec vous. Vous avez de belles qualités, quoi que cette personne puisse vous dire. Elle vous harcèle probablement à cause d'une des raisons suivantes  :   le désir de se sentir puissant la jalousie le besoin de prouver aux autres qu'elle est forte le besoin de se sentir fort la recherche d'un exutoire à sa douleur intérieure une réponse au harcèlement qu'elle subit elle-même La chose la plus simple est de vous éloigner de la personne qui vous harcèle. Vous pouvez aussi rester où vous êtes et l'ignorer. Autrement, vous pouvez prendre votre défense en lui disant calmement que vous n'êtes pas intéressé par ce qu'il dit. La chose la plus importante à ce moment-là est de garder votre sang-froid. Vous ne voulez pas avoir une réaction trop émotionnelle et prendre le risque d'y répondre de manière agressive.  En répondant à la personne qui vous harcèle avec humour, vous deviendrez souvent une cible moins intéressante. Les réponses amusantes font souvent perdre leur intérêt aux personnes qui harcèlent les autres, ce qui signifie qu'il ne viendra plus vous embêter. Assurez-vous de rester en sécurité. Ce n'est pas parce que vous répondez sans être agressif que vous devez vous mettre dans une situation où vous n'êtes pas en sécurité. S'il vous blesse physiquement, vous pouvez vous protéger pour vous échapper d'une situation où vous prenez un risque pour votre sécurité . Si cette personne n'est pas confrontée à ses actes, elle va devenir de plus en plus agressive envers vous. Il est très important d'en parler à un adulte de confiance pour éviter que la situation dégénère .  Soyez implacable pour que cette personne arrête de vous harceler. Signalez chaque incident jusqu'à ce qu'il s'arrête. N'ayez jamais honte de demander de l'aide. Vous n'êtes probablement pas la seule personne que cet individu harcèle, mais vous pouvez aider à mettre fin à son comportement. La plupart du temps, les adultes peuvent trouver des solutions au problème sans dire à cette personne que vous les avez informés de son comportement. Certaines solutions pourraient impliquer que vous changiez de classe ou que vous changiez de place en classe. La personne qui vous harcèle pourrait aussi recevoir des punitions. Si vous êtes le témoin du harcèlement de quelqu'un d'autre, vous devez aussi le signaler. Personne ne mérite de se faire harceler. Souvenez-vous que la personne qui vous harcèle est simplement quelqu'un de malheureux qui essaye de vous faire tomber aussi bas qu'elle . Lorsque vous pensez à partir de son point de vue, le harcèlement perd un peu de son pouvoir. Souvenez-vous que vous ne devez pas le laisser contrôler vos émotions.  Dressez une liste de toutes les choses positives chez vous. Vous pouvez y inclure toutes les bonnes choses qui se passent dans votre vie. Chaque fois que vous avez le cafard, vous pouvez relire votre liste. Essayez de ne pas faire empirer la situation en ressassant l'incident et en le repassant en permanence dans votre tête. À la place, concentrez-vous sur les choses positives qui se sont produites pendant votre journée. Assurez-vous de discuter de vos expériences. Même si vous ne voulez pas ressasser le harcèlement toute la journée, il est important de trouver une occasion d'exprimer ce que vous ressentez. Vous pouvez discuter avec un parent, un membre de votre famille, un professeur, un conseiller, un prêtre ou un ami. Vous allez probablement vous sentir mieux en en discutant .  Donnez-vous le temps de guérir. Le harcèlement est une expérience plutôt traumatisante. Il va être utile d'en parler, mais il va vous falloir un peu de temps avant de pouvoir vous sentir de nouveau normal. Vous pouvez demander de l'aide à un professionnel si vous remarquez que vous avez du mal à gérer vos sentiments de colère, vos blessures ou toute autre émotion négatifs. Le bénévolat est une excellente façon de faire disparaitre un sentiment d'impuissance qui pourrait apparaitre lorsque vous êtes la victime de harcèlements . Vous pourriez aider d'autres adolescents ou des enfants plus jeunes qui ont été victimes de harcèlement ou vous pourriez participer à une campagne contre le harcèlement dans votre école. Ce que vous choisissez n'a pas d'importance, cependant il est important de retrouver un sens de contrôle en devenant plus actif.\n",
        "   1  Si vous voulez être un bon joueur dans votre équipe, vous devez tout d'abord travailler à devenir un bon sportif en général, en passant du temps à développer les compétences de base nécessaires au sport que vous pratiquez. Si vous voulez devenir un bon joueur de basketball, vous devez passer du temps à dribbler, à développer vos compétences en matière de défense et de passes efficaces. Si vous voulez devenir un bon joueur de football, vous devez apprendre à contrôler le ballon, à tirer correctement et à vous déplacer sur le terrain.  Il est très amusant de sortir et d'aller jouer au sport qui vous plaît, mais il est important de vous entraîner. Au lieu de simplement jouer avec la balle, entraînez-vous à dribbler ou répétez des mouvements de défense que votre entraîneur vous a appris. Vous aurez plus de chances de vous démarquer des autres et de devenir un bon joueur si vous travaillez les compétences moins amusantes nécessaires à votre sport. Le sport en équipe présuppose que chacun tient une position particulière. À la différence du tennis ou du golf, vous devez remplir une fonction lorsque vous jouez en équipe. Tous les joueurs lors d'une partie de football ne marquent pas des buts, tous les joueurs de basketball ne mettent pas des paniers. Un bon joueur connaît les responsabilités liées à sa position et a appris à remplir son rôle le mieux possible.  Apprenez la position que vous devez tenir sur le terrain et quelles actions vous devez faire. Si vous jouez en défense, apprenez à choisir un adversaire et à le marquer. Si vous êtes en possession du ballon, apprenez les meilleures façons de faire suivre l'action. Lorsque vous apprenez à jouer à un sport au début, il est normal de vouloir occuper une position plus glorieuse, par exemple attaquant ou libéro. Cependant, une bonne équipe est faite de joueurs qui tiennent les positions les mieux adaptées à leurs compétences. Si vous êtes un bon défenseur, ne gaspillez pas votre énergie en étant jaloux des attaquants. Donnez-vous à fond dans votre rôle et entraînez-vous pour améliorer vos compétences. Il est très important de vous entraîner dur et de donner tout ce que vous avez si vous voulez devenir un bon joueur en équipe. Entraînez-vous sans relâche pour améliorer vos compétences et vos connaissances du sport que vous pratiquez, afin de vous préparer, ainsi que votre équipe, au succès.  Arrivez à l'heure lors des entraînements et préparez-vous à travailler. Préparez votre équipement et beaucoup d'eau pour rester hydraté. Échauffez-vous et préparez-vous à l'entraînement. Vous devez comprendre que l'entraînement est très important. Certains sportifs sont très doués, mais ils se comportent comme s'ils préfèreraient être à la maison devant la console de jeu plutôt qu'avec leurs coéquipiers. Vous pouvez être meilleur que cela. Faites de votre mieux pendant l'entraînement. Si vous ne voulez pas trop forcer alors que vous êtes censé lever des haltères, courir des tours de terrain ou faire des exercices, vous allez être plus lent, plus faible et moins doué que vos adversaires. Développez ces qualités lors de vos entraînements. Même si vous êtes un bon sportif, vous ne pouvez pas être un bon joueur si vous passez votre temps à vous remettre de blessures ou à rester assis sur le banc de touche. Vous devez prendre le plus grand soin de votre corps et restez en bonne santé pour faire face à vos adversaires et donner à votre équipe toutes les chances de victoire.  Échauffez-vous avant l'entraînement et reposez-vous après, à chaque fois. Ne courez jamais sur le terrain sans avoir fait des étirements et des échauffements, pour préparer votre corps à l'effort physique. Les bons joueurs doivent aussi prendre quelques minutes pour s'étirer après l'entraînement, pour éviter les crampes et les irritations. Reposez-vous suffisamment entre vos entraînements. Si vous devez retourner à l'entraînement demain, vous ne devez pas vous coucher au petit matin parce que vous avez passé la nuit à jouer à la X-Box ou à chatter en ligne. Dormez suffisamment, au moins 8 heures par nuit et laissez suffisamment de temps à votre corps pour se remettre et pour se reposer avant de le remettre au travail le lendemain. Une étude sur les joueurs de la NFL a démontré qu'environ 98% d'entre eux étaient déshydratés après les entraînements, ce qui peut conduire à des pertes de performances de 25%. Les boissons énergétiques et l'eau sont des éléments importants qui vous aident à rester hydraté et à conserver les électrolytes dans votre corps, ce qui vous donne ensuite suffisamment d'énergie pour être au top de vos performances et pour rester en bonne santé. Avant l'entraînement, buvez environ un demi-litre d'eau et essayez de boire environ 250 ml d'eau toutes les 15 minutes pendant votre entraînement. Buvez lentement pour éviter de déranger votre estomac pendant ces séances d'efforts physiques intenses. Les bons joueurs doivent être faciles à entraîner, ce qui signifie que vous devez savoir recevoir les critiques et appliquer les nouvelles techniques qui vous sont données pour pouvoir vous améliorer sur le terrain. Le travail des entraîneurs n'est pas de dire aux joueurs qu'ils font du bon travail et que tout le monde deviendra joueurs professionnels. Les entraîneurs sont là pour faire de vous un meilleur athlète et pour vous amener vers la victoire. Parfois, cela signifie que vous devrez entendre des suggestions ou des critiques.  Les mauvais joueurs se referment et sont frustrés lorsqu'ils reçoivent des critiques, alors que les bons joueurs vont écouter et en tirer des leçons. Si votre entraîneur vous rappelle à l'ordre parce que vous ne descendez pas assez pendant que vous faites des pompes, cela peut vous mettre de mauvaise humeur ou vous pouvez répondre Oui coach ! et transpirer un peu plus. Ne vous disputez jamais avec votre entraîneur, surtout en face des autres joueurs. Si vous n'êtes pas d'accord avec la stratégie ou avec quelque chose que votre entraîneur vous a dit pendant l'entraînement, demandez-lui de le rencontrer en privé et parlez-en avec lui. Les bons joueurs ne remettent jamais en question l'autorité de leur entraîneur en face du reste de l'équipe. Les équipes sportives doivent être organisées et coordonnées pour pouvoir gagner. Les équipes silencieuses perdent et les équipes bavardes augmentent leurs chances de gagner. Vous devez vous entraîner à parler plus que les autres équipes. Il est important de parler avec vos coéquipiers, mais évitez d'insulter vos adversaires. À moins que cela devienne nécessaire pour motiver vos coéquipiers. Faites-le, mais faites-le gentiment. Il n'est pas toujours amusant de s'entraîner et le sport que vous pratiquez peut être vraiment fatigant. Mais les bons joueurs (et les excellents joueurs) apprennent à oublier la douleur pendant leurs entraînements et à la combattre. Lorsque vous êtes fatigué à la fin d'une partie et que le ballon se retrouve entre vous et le but, vous pouvez courir après en tirant la langue ou vous pouvez rassembler vos dernières forces et vous lancer dans un sprint. Les bons joueurs courent très vite Trouvez des façons de rester motivé et alerte pendant la partie afin de conserver toute votre énergie et tout votre enthousiasme tout le long de la partie. Passez de la musique forte qui vous donne envie de courir, mettez-vous dans l'ambiance en regardant un film sportif ou faites des exercices de groupes qui vous plaisent.\n",
        "   2  Lorsque le moment est venu de jouer au jeu de la bouteille, la première chose dont vous aurez besoin sera d'autres personnes (à moins que vous vouliez jouer tout seul, ce qui serait une scène assez triste). Pour commencer, créez un groupe d'amis volontaires. Plus nombreux vous êtes, plus vous vous amuserez ! Essayez de constituer un groupe composé de personnes des deux sexes afin qu'il puisse avoir un éventail de plusieurs combinaisons de personnes potentielles qui pourront s'embrasser. Prenez soin de faire savoir à vos amis de quoi il s'agit avant de commencer le jeu. Un baiser est une chose qui est d'habitude réservée à des personnes qui s'aiment réellement, donc le fait d'obliger des personnes qui ne veulent pas s'embrasser à le faire peut être vraiment embarrassant pour chacune des personnes impliquées. N'obligez personne à jouer avec vous contre son gré. Quand tout le monde est prêt (et se porte volontaire) pour jouer, disposez-vous en cercle de manière à ce que chacun ait la face tournée vers l'intérieur du cercle. D'habitude, on le fait sur le sol, cependant rien n'empêche que vous le fassiez également debout ou assis autour d'une table. Peu importe comment vous faites pour disposer votre groupe en cercle, mais il est généralement préférable de choisir un endroit dont la surface est dure, solide, comme un endroit ayant un plancher en bois. Ceci garantit que la bouteille que vous utiliserez pourra bien tourner sans érafler ou endommager le plancher. Quand vous êtes tous prêts à jouer, choisissez une personne pour commencer le jeu. Cette personne saisira une bouteille (ou, en réalité, tout objet similaire pouvant être tournoyé, comme un bic, un verre, une clé, etc.) et la fera tournoyer fortement au milieu du cercle de joueurs. Après que la bouteille ait commencé à tournoyer, personne ne doit la toucher jusqu'à ce qu'elle s'arrête complètement. Si vous hésitez quant au moyen de choisir celui ou celle qui doit faire tourner la bouteille le premier ou la première, vous pourrez choisir de laisser d'abord jouer les joueurs les plus âgés ou les plus jeunes ou bien vous pouvez demander à quelqu'un d'imaginer un nombre par hasard et commencer le jeu par celui qui imaginera par la suite un nombre qui est plus proche de celui de ce dernier. Lorsque la bouteille s'arrête, son cou (le bout ouvert) doit surement pointer une personne faisant partie du cercle. La personne qui a fait tournoyer la bouteille doit embrasser cette dernière !  Si vous n'utilisez pas une bouteille, alors désignez un des bouts de l'objet, qui sera considéré comme le bout qui servira à pointer les personnes. Par exemple, si vous utilisez un bic, vous pouvez décider d'utiliser le bout qui sert à écrire en tant que sa « pointe ». Si vous faites tourner la bouteille et qu'elle s'arrête sur vous, faites-la tournoyer à nouveau. C'est aussi simple que cela ! Après qu'une personne ait fait tourner la bouteille et ait donné un baiser à la personne pointée à la fin par la bouteille, la personne qui est assise à côté de lui ou d'elle dans le cercle fait tournoyer la bouteille et donne un baiser à celui ou celle que la bouteille pointe à la fin de son action. Opérez les tournoiements dans un sens unique, soit dans le sens de déplacement d'une montre ou dans le sens contraire.  Notez que parfois la bouteille s'arrêtera de tourner en pointant l'espace entre deux personnes, dans ce cas, vous devez décider que celui qui a fait tournoyer la bouteille embrasse la personne la plus proche du champ de pointage de la bouteille. Également, la bouteille peut pointer une personne que vous n'avez pas envie d'embrasser en raison de vos préférences sentimentales (par exemple, si vous êtes attiré(e) par des garçons et que le pointage tombe sur une fille). Dans ce cas, vous pouvez choisir d'embrasser la personne du sexe approprié qui est installée le plus proche du champ de pointage de la bouteille. Félicitations ! Vous avez appris comment jouer au jeu de la bouteille. Ce jeu amusant et facile est plus intéressant lorsqu'il se joue dans une attitude joviale de la part de tous les joueurs. Ne laissez pas tourner les choses dans une ambiance trop romantique ou sexuelle, c'est juste un jeu, mais il peut devenir très vite assez embarrassant s'il est trop pris au sérieux. Toutefois, si vous ressentez une étincelle significative avec une personne après le jeu, il n'y a aucune raison qui vous empêcherait de chercher à la connaitre « après » le jeu ! Le jeu de la bouteille est très approprié pour déclencher de nouvelles amitiés que vous n'auriez pas pu avoir en temps normal.\n",
        "   3  Si vous essayez de garder votre sérieux pendant que vous discutez avec quelqu'un, engagez-vous encore plus dans la conversation. Vous pouvez y arriver par exemple en posant des questions. C'est une excellente façon de diriger la conversation vers un sujet qui ne vous fait pas rire .  Par exemple, si la personne avec laquelle vous discutez parle de son travail, mais si elle glisse vers un sujet que vous trouvez drôle, vous pouvez essayer de lui poser des questions qui vont la rediriger vers le sujet de son emploi. Vous pourriez dire par exemple : « pourrais-tu m'en dire plus à propos de ton parcours professionnel ? » ou bien « comment t'es-tu lancé dans ce domaine ? » Si vous avez du mal à garder votre sérieux pendant que vous racontez une blague ou que vous jouez à un jeu, entrainez-vous en avance. Répétez la blague autant de fois que nécessaire jusqu'à ce que vous puissiez la raconter en gardant votre sérieux. Vous pouvez aussi vous entrainer à répéter les choses dont vous allez parler pour vous distraire pendant le jeu et garder votre sérieux.  Si vous essayez de penser à autre chose pendant un jeu, discutez d'un sujet qui n'a aucun rapport. Par exemple, si vous jouez au poker, ne discutez pas d'autres parties de poker auxquelles vous avez participé. Parlez plutôt de ce qu'il se passe au travail ou d'un incident qui s'est produit pendant que vous étiez au supermarché. Les gens avec lesquels vous discutez vont se sentir écoutés si vous étayez ce qu'ils disent avec des expériences personnelles similaires. En réfléchissant à votre passé, vous allez oublier le présent et vous allez mieux arriver à contrôler votre visage. Par exemple, si quelqu'un vous raconte une histoire embarrassante qui a l'air de lui faire un peu de mal, vous pouvez aussi partager une histoire embarrassante. Cela va vous empêcher de rire et aider l'autre personne à se sentir mieux dans la conversation.\n",
        "   4  Submergez le crâne dans un grand container rempli d'eau. Incluez seulement 300 à 450 ml de peroxyde d'hydrogène à 35 % pour environ 5 l d'eau .  N'utilisez pas d'eau de javel, car cela risque d'endommager les os et les dents. Cela va blanchir le crâne. Les crânes sont naturellement d'une couleur blanche crème à jaunâtre. Laissez le crâne dans l'eau pendant au moins 24 heures. Si vous avez utilisé une méthode à base d'eau pour nettoyer le crâne, les dents vont tomber des mâchoires de la bête. Gardez les dents et remettez-les en place à l'aide d'une petite quantité de colle forte . La plupart des animaux dont le crâne est utilisé en préservation sont des carnivores. Ils possèdent donc une paire de canines. Ces canines ont tendance à être beaucoup plus petites que les alvéoles auxquelles elles sont fixées. Utilisez des boules de coton trempées dans de la colle. Enroulez la dent dans un peu de coton et insérez le tout dans l'alvéole. Laissez le crâne 24 heures à l'extérieur pour le sécher au soleil et laisser la colle prendre. Le crâne ne contiendra plus aucune matière organique. Vous n'aurez donc plus à vous inquiéter des animaux ou des insectes. Vaporisez plusieurs couches de polyuréthane sur le crâne. Laissez chaque couche sécher avant d'appliquer la suivante. Cela va laisser une finition lisse et brillante.\n",
        "   5  Broyez tous les assaisonnements dans un mixeur jusqu'à ce que les particules fassent toutes la même taille. Les ingrédients à moudre sont le sel de cèleri, le sel à l'ail et le sel nature ainsi que les herbes séchées, le poivre noir et blanc moulu, la moutarde en poudre et le paprika. Mixez-les jusqu'à obtention d'une poudre homogène.  Pour obtenir une saveur plus authentique, ajoutez également une cuillère à café de sel aux herbes par kilogramme de poulet. Si vous ne trouvez pas d'origan ou de thym, essayez de la marjolaine et de la sauge. Versez-la dans un cul-de-poule et ajoutez les épices moulues. Mélangez les ingrédients avec un fouet jusqu'à ce que la poudre soit homogène. Mettez le cul-de-poule de côté pour le moment. Vous allez y mettre les morceaux de viande. Le récipient doit être suffisamment grand pour accommoder au moins un blanc ou une cuisse de poulet. Battez-les ensemble dans un récipient à part. Ne les ajoutez pas à la farine assaisonnée. Cassez l'œuf dans un grand cul-de-poule et ajoutez le petit-lait ou le yaourt. Fouettez les deux ingrédients jusqu'à ce que le mélange soit homogène et qu'il ne reste plus de trace de jaune d'œuf. Assurez-vous que le récipient est suffisamment grand et profond pour que vous puissiez immerger complètement tous les morceaux de poulet.\n",
        "   6  Il s'agit de cinq lignes horizontales superposées fermées aux deux extrémités. À gauche, vous trouverez une clé (de sol pour une partition de guitare), deux numéros superposés, par exemple 44{\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{4}}} et parfois une série de bémols ou de dièses. Toutes ces indications sur la portée donnent les informations relatives au rythme et à la tonalité du morceau.   Un morceau pour guitare peut également se noter sous forme de tablature, système de notation musicale particulier fait pour la guitare. Une tablature ressemble à une portée traditionnelle, mais comprend six lignes au lieu de cinq, aucune clé et souvent le mot « tab » écrit sur la gauche. Les partitions pour guitare se notent toujours en clé de sol, ce qui signifie que le symbole tout à fait à gauche de la portée est une clé de sol (un G ancien très stylisé) formant une boucle autour de la deuxième ligne à partir du bas . Chaque ligne de la portée correspond à une note, comme un mi, un sol, etc. Lorsque vous voyez une figure de note sur la partition, vous devez jouer la note à laquelle sa position correspond, mais pour cela, vous devez savoir de laquelle il s'agit. En allant de bas en haut, les notes qui correspondent aux lignes de la portée sont mi, sol, si, ré et fa. Les espaces entre les lignes de la portée correspondent également à des notes. La portée comprend ainsi neuf notes de base (sans compter celles altérées par des dièses ou des bémols, que nous aborderons plus tard). En allant de bas en haut, les notes qui correspondent aux interlignes sont fa, la, do et mi. En prenant l'ensemble des lignes et des interlignes, la portée entière avec toutes les notes correspond au schéma ci-dessous :   fa mi ré do si la sol fa mi Des traits supplémentaires au-delà de la portée principale permettent d'étendre la gamme de notes que l'on peut écrire. Si vous voyez une figure de note avec un petit trait horizontal au-dessus ou au-dessous de la portée, il s'agit d'une note plus aigüe ou plus grave que celles qui se trouvent sur les lignes et les interlignes de base.  Chacun de ces petits traits permet d'ajouter deux notes, une avec la tête de note à hauteur du trait et une en dessous, mais pour le moment, apprenez simplement les bases. Elle vous permettra de déterminer la tonalité du morceau. L'armure est un ensemble d'altérations qui se trouve entre la clé et le chiffrage de mesure au début de la partition. Elle comprend une série de dièses (♯), de bémols (♭) qui se suivent sur la portée. Pour connaitre les tonalités qui correspondent aux différentes armures, vous devez simplement les mémoriser. Cependant, même si vous ne connaissez pas la tonalité, l'armure peut vous donner des informations très utiles.  En fonction de la ligne ou de l'interligne où se trouve une altération, vous devez ajuster la hauteur de la note correspondante dans toute la partition. Par exemple, s'il y a un dièse à sur la ligne du fa et un dans l'interligne du do, vous devez jouer des fa et des do dièses dans tout le morceau. Cela ajustera automatiquement la tonalité. Elle vous aidera à connaitre la cadence rythmique du morceau. Le chiffrage de mesure qui se trouve au début de la partition indique le nombre de temps par mesure. Le plus commun est 44{\\displaystyle {\\frac {4}{4}}}, ce qui signifie que chaque mesure comprend quatre noires. Autrement dit, vous devez compter « 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, », etc. pour garder le rythme. D'autres chiffrages donnent d'autres nombres de temps par mesure. Par exemple, 34{\\displaystyle {\\frac {3}{4}}} indique que chaque mesure comprend trois noires (« 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, », etc.). Les mesures individuelles dans la partition sont séparées par des barres verticales qui coupent la portée. Il y a souvent des numéros au-dessus de chaque portée pour indiquer les numéros de mesures afin qu'un orchestre puisse s'y retrouver facilement. La position d'une note sur la portée détermine sa hauteur. Sa forme (appelée figure de note) indique sa durée. Dans une mesure à quatre temps dont l'unité de temps est la noire (unité la plus commune), une ronde dure une mesure (quatre temps), une blanche dure la moitié d'une mesure (deux temps), la noire dure un quart de mesure (un temps) et ainsi de suite jusqu'à la triple croche. Les figures de notes les plus communes sont les suivantes.    La ronde : O   La blanche : une forme de ronde avec une hampe verticale (ou une forme de noire avec une tête de note blanche)  La noire : ♩  Les silences : un intervalle où il ne faut pas jouer de note, représenté par une pause (un petit trait horizontal gras placé au centre de la mesure) lorsque le silence vaut la durée d'une ronde ou d'une blanche et par un soupir (un petit trait vertical ondulé) lorsque le silence vaut la durée d'une noire\n",
        "   7  Parler d'un ami commun vous aidera à créer un lien personnel avec cette fille, même si vous ne la connaissez pas bien. Elle se sentira plus à l'aise, car vous ne serez plus un parfait inconnu. Avoir un ami commun vous donnera également un sujet de conversation tout désigné.  Essayez de dire quelque chose comme « J'ai entendu dire que tu as une amie de Carine. Comment est-ce que vous vous êtes rencontrées ? » Ou alors « Tu connais Dan ? On se connait depuis des années ! Il est hilarant, n'est-ce pas ? » Parler d'une expérience commune (qu'il s'agisse de faire du bénévolat ou de grandir dans une ferme) vous aidera à créer une connexion personnelle entre vous deux et à établir le début d'un lien.   Si vous réalisez que vous avez tous deux grandi dans une ferme, vous pourriez dire quelque chose comme « Ce n’est pas vrai ! Moi aussi ! Le pire c'était l'été, quand mon père me réveillait à 5 heures du matin pour que je l'aide dans les champs ! C'était comment pour toi ? » Si vous avez tous les deux faits du bénévolat, vous pourriez dire quelque chose comme « J'ai trouvé que c'était une expérience très enrichissante. Qu'est-ce qui t'a poussé à t'impliquer dans ce projet ? » Poser une question inhabituelle et stimulante à la fille permettra de briser la glace et sera l'occasion pour elle de dire ce qu'elle pense. Elle aura ainsi une chance de s'exprimer et vous ferez bonne impression pour avoir posé une question si intéressante. Gagnant-gagnant !  Essayez quelque chose comme « Si tu pouvais être un animal, quel genre d'animal serais-tu ? » Ou quelque chose comme « Quels sont les 5 endroits que tu veux visiter avant de mourir ? » Ou peut-être « Est-ce que tu oserais faire un saut en parachute ? » Découvrir que vous avez un centre d'intérêt est de l'or en matière de conversation. Cela vous aidera à établir un lien avec la fille. Quel que soit ce centre d'intérêt : la lecture, la course à pied, l'aviron, l'escalade, l'important est de partager quelque chose.  Si vous découvrez que vous aimez tous les deux la course à pied, vous pourriez lui demander quels sont ses itinéraires préférés ou si elle a déjà pensé à s'entrainer pour un marathon. Si vous aimez tous les deux la lecture, demandez-lui quel est son auteur préféré ou ce qu'elle a pensé d'une adaptation cinématographique récente d'un roman très connu. Si c'est un centre d'intérêt très original, demandez-lui comment elle est arrivée à s'y intéresser et comparez vos histoires. Si les choses se passent bien et que vous deux semblez bien vous entendre, il est peut-être temps de devenir un petit peu plus personnel. Souvenez-vous que le but est de montrer qu'elle vous intéresse et que voulez la connaitre, pas la mettre mal à l'aise. Ne posez pas de question qui vous mettraient vous-même mal à l'aise.   Restez positif ! Ne lui demandez pas quelle est sa plus grande peur ou son secret le plus lourd, posez-lui des questions sur ses rêves d'avenir, ses projets pour dans dix ans. Restez-en aux questions auxquelles elle veut bien répondre et restez léger. Essayez de lui poser des questions sur sa famille, essayez quelque chose de simple et de non invasif « Tu as des frères et sœurs ? » Si vous voulez savoir si elle est célibataire, demandez-lui simplement « Tu as quelqu'un dans ta vie en ce moment ? »\n",

        "   9  Pour ce que nous savons de nos jours, les chats peuvent s'exprimer avec 16 types de miaulements. Pour améliorer votre communication, vous devez prêter beaucoup d'attention aux sonorités que votre ami félin produit.  Un miaulement court exprime normalement que vous êtes le (la) bienvenu. Des miaulements répétitifs montrent de l'excitation. Un miaulement ayant un ton moyen est généralement une demande, le plus souvent liée à la nourriture. Un miaulement profond signale surement du mécontentement. Un miaulement aigu peut indiquer de la douleur ou du mécontentement. Un miaulement long mrrrrowww exprime un besoin . Par nature, les chatons commencent à miauler dans la vie pour attirer l'attention de leur mère. Ils font cela en réalisant que vous ne répondez pas à d'autres signaux. Les miaulements expriment souvent un besoin ou un désir, mais ils peuvent également communiquer bien d'autres choses.  La plupart du temps, le miaulement de votre matou est une demande. Il vous dit par exemple qu'il veut de l'eau, de la nourriture, de l'affection ou la possibilité de changer de pièce, d'endroit. Un miaulement peut aussi être un signal de détresse. Les chats vont miauler quand ils sont stressés, quand ils ont trop chaud, quand ils se sentent seuls, quand ils souffrent, ou encore, quand ils sont de mauvaise humeur. En grandissant, ils vont s'exprimer de manière plus fréquente. Parfois, un miaulement peut simplement être le signe qu'il vous souhaite la bienvenue . Les chats communiquent principalement avec le langage corporel. Ils ont un système de communication très élaboré composé de signaux qu'ils expriment grâce à leur jolie queue !  Si votre matou vous regarde dans les yeux tout en faisant un lent et long battement des paupières, il vous montre de l'affection. Vous pouvez comparer cela à un bisou. Si votre ami s'approche de vous avec la queue levée, c'est une forme de vous montrer qu'il est heureux de vous voir et de vous souhaiter la bienvenue. Ceci peut être comparé à une solide poignée de mains . Lorsque le pelage de votre chat est dressé, il exprime un sentiment d'insécurité, de la peur ou encore du mécontentement. Si vous voyez que la queue de votre ami est entre ses jambes et basse, il montre qu'il est anxieux et mal à l'aise. S'il remue la queue, il exprime qu'il n'est pas content du tout. Plus la queue se déplace rapidement, plus votre chat est de mauvaise humeur .\n",
        "  10  Une méduse, même morte, reste toxique et son poison peut toujours provoquer une piqure. Certaines espèces ont des tentacules très longs, comme les méduses portugaises dont les membres peuvent être de près de dix mètres de long. Il est donc préférable de rester à l'écart des méduses échouées .  Il existe toutes sortes de méduses et elles peuvent ressembler à des sacs en plastique ou à d'autres débris quand elles sont échouées sur une plage. Il est préférable de ne pas y toucher, si vous ne savez pas au juste s'il s'agit d'une méduse ou non. Prévenez un sauveteur ou un responsable de la plage si vous avez remarqué une méduse sur le rivage, afin que la créature soit enlevée en toute sécurité par une personne qui sait comment la manipuler. Les sauveteurs en mer sont formés pour venir au secours des baigneurs dans des situations diverses, y compris les attaques de méduses. Ils sont aussi en mesure de vous prévenir quand ils ont remarqué la présence de méduses. Vous pouvez perturber et faire déguerpir quelques méduses ou d'autres créatures qui peuvent vous piquer, si vous remuez le courant en marchant dans des eaux peu profondes . Vous pouvez souvent voir la méduse dans l'eau. Elle peut ressembler à un sac en plastique ou à un ballon qui flotte à la surface de l'eau et peut se présenter en grappes . Retournez calmement sur le rivage pour éviter une piqure si vous voyez une méduse dans l'eau.  Prévenez un sauveteur ou un responsable de la plage quand vous avez remarqué une méduse dans l'eau, afin que les autres baigneurs soient prévenus aussi.\n",
        "  11  Ce qu'il y a de bien avec la lecture est évidemment de pouvoir le faire quasiment n'importe quand et n'importe où. Mais le fait de choisir un moment précis de la journée pour le faire peut vous aider, si ce que vous lisez ne vous enthousiasme pas vraiment. Mettez en route une sonnerie de réveil ou créez-vous une sonnerie de rappel sur le téléphone pour vous signaler votre temps de lecture et la fin de la période, cherchez votre livre et allez-y.   Prévoyez des périodes de temps assez gérables. Prévoyez de petites pauses pour vous lever et vous étirer environ toutes les vingt minutes si vous lisez d'une traite une heure ou plus. Variez votre menu. Vous n'avez pas besoin de toujours lire au même endroit. Vous pouvez le faire dehors, si le temps s'y prête. Vous pouvez aussi vous rendre dans une bibliothèque ou un café près de chez vous pour changer, si vous en avez assez de lire chez vous. Vous pouvez toujours trouver une occasion de lire. Vous pourriez être coincé dans la salle d'attente du dentiste pendant une demi-heure ou arriver vingt minutes en avance à un cours de natation. Vous pouvez tirer parti de ces périodes d'attente si vous avez emporté votre livre et avancer un peu dans votre lecture.  Les livres électroniques vous facilitent encore la tâche, étant donné que vous pouvez lire votre ouvrage directement sur votre téléphone mobile. Le meilleur moyen d'aller au bout de votre liste de lectures est de lire un peu chaque jour, indépendamment de la nature de votre planning. Cela va non seulement vous aider à avancer dans votre liste, mais cela vous évitera aussi de perdre le fil de ce que vous étiez en train de lire et vous épargner une relecture fastidieuse. Il est probable qu'on vous interrogera sur vos lectures ou qu'on vous demandera de faire un devoir sur table à ce sujet, si vous devez aller au bout d'une liste de lectures. Le fait de prendre des notes vous aidera à vous souvenir de ce que vous avez lu. Vous n'avez sans doute pas besoin de faire des notes détaillées, mais plutôt vous procurer quelques informations de base comme le nom des personnages principaux et leurs caractéristiques, un résumé du sujet de l'histoire pour chaque chapitre . Votre emploi du temps risque d'être rapidement chargé et quasiment impossible à suivre si vous manquez l'un de vos délais. Si vous êtes à la traine, annulez d'autres activités si c'est nécessaire et rattrapez votre retard le plus vite possible. Vous vous en féliciterez à la fin du mois d'aout (ou de septembre, si vous entrez en fac). Ne cherchez pas à deviner le sens de mots que vous ne comprenez pas. Vérifiez-les dans un dictionnaire ! Recherchez autour de vous des personnes qui ont déjà lu ce livre, si vous avez du mal à comprendre l'intrigue de l'histoire ou lisez une analyse de lecture de l'œuvre dans une bibliothèque ou en ligne.  Le fait de lire un résumé ou une analyse de livre peut vous aider, mais cela ne devrait pas remplacer la lecture de cet ouvrage. Rencontrez celui ou celle qui est d'accord pour commenter le livre et comparer ses notes aux vôtres, si la personne lit le même livre que vous. Envisagez de regarder ensemble le film le plus récent qui s'est inspiré de ce livre quand vous avez tous deux fini de le lire, si vous pouvez en trouver un. Vous pouvez ensuite voir ensemble en quoi le film diffère du livre et quelle est votre version préférée. Vous pouvez aussi disserter sur les détails de l'épreuve que vous venez de passer. Il peut être difficile d'être enthousiaste au sujet de l'obligation de lire de façon compulsive, mais vous ne devriez pas oublier que la plupart des livres figurant sur votre liste ont été choisis parce qu'ils sont vraiment bons. Ignorez le fait que vous êtes obligé de lire tous les livres de votre liste et essayez d'apprécier cette expérience. Vous pourriez être agréablement surpris par le côté amusant et intéressant de ce devoir de vacances.\n",
        "  12  Il apportera un peu de vie au texte. En ce qui concerne le format, une présentation informelle est semblable à une description professionnelle, la différence majeure étant le niveau de langue. Dans un contexte non formel, faites ressortir votre personnalité à l’aide d’humour, de traits d’esprit et de mots évocateurs . Contrairement à une écriture formelle, vous pouvez employer des contractions, des points d’exclamation et d’autres éléments non formels. Toutefois, assurez-vous que votre grammaire est correcte et évitez d’employer de l’argot et de gros mots. Comme pour une description formelle, expliquez qui vous êtes et donnez des informations clés sur vous-même. S’il y a des consignes, respectez-les. Vérifiez également si vous devez écrire à la première ou à la troisième personne. Si vous pouvez faire ce que vous voulez, choisissez ce qui vous semble le plus naturel. En général, il est préférable d’employer la première personne sur les réseaux sociaux . Vous pouvez écrire quelque chose comme : « Marion Dubois est coach de vie depuis plus de 10 ans. Sa passion est d’aider ses clients à vivre leur vie le mieux possible. Pendant son temps libre, elle aime faire des câlins à ses chats et faire de la randonnée avec son époux, Simon. » Parlez de loisirs, de centres d’intérêt ou d’autres éléments qui permettront aux lecteurs de mieux vous connaitre. Vous pouvez parler de vos animaux de compagnie, de votre famille, d’un talent particulier ou d’une expérience en rapport avec le but de votre présentation . Si vous rédigez une présentation pour un article de cuisine que vous avez écrit, vous pouvez écrire quelque chose comme : « Ma passion pour la cuisine remonte à mon enfance, lorsque ma grand-mère m’apprenait ses vieilles recettes de famille. Je me suis rendu compte que la nourriture était intimement liée à la famille, à l’histoire et à la tradition. » En général, respectez une limite de cent à deux-cents mots. Vous ne rédigez pas une dissertation ou une autobiographie. Tâchez de rester concis(e). Dans la plupart des cas, un paragraphe court composé de trois à cinq phrases et comprenant cent à deux-cents mots en tout est suffisant pour fournir les informations clés . Si vous ne savez pas quelle longueur est appropriée, cherchez des consignes ou des exemples de présentations que d’autres personnes ont écrites pour vous servir de modèles. Par exemple, si vous avez écrit un article qui sera publié dans une revue et que vous devez vous présenter, cherchez des présentations d’autres auteurs.\n",
        "  13  Il est tout à fait possible pour une personne de faire des recherches, planifier, filmer et modifier un documentaire seule, surtout si l'étendue du documentaire est relativement resserrée ou intimiste. Cependant, beaucoup de personnes trouveront cette approche trop difficile ou penseront que c'est de l'amateurisme. Pensez à recruter une aide expérimentée pour votre documentaire, surtout si vous vous attaquez à un sujet ambitieux ou si vous voulez que votre film ait l'air abouti et professionnel. Pour obtenir de l'aide, vous pouvez recruter des amis et des connaissances qualifiées qui feront de la publicité pour votre projet en distribuant des prospectus ou en postant des messages en ligne ou bien contacter une agence. Voici quelques types de professionnels qu'il faut penser à recruter :  des caméramans des régisseurs éclairagistes des scénaristes des chercheurs des monteurs des acteurs (pour les séquences écrites) des techniciens audios des consultants techniques Lorsque vous recrutez votre équipe, cherchez des gens qui partagent les mêmes valeurs lorsqu'il s'agit de la problématique de votre documentaire. Pensez aussi à engager une jeune équipe inspirée et au fait du marché et du public que vous visez.  Discutez toujours avec votre cadreur et les autres créatifs qui sont impliqués dans votre documentaire. Cela vous aidera à en faire le fruit d'un effort collectif partageant la même vision. Travailler dans un environnement collaboratif signifie que votre équipe trouvera souvent de nouvelles idées en contribuant au projet sous des angles que vous pourriez avoir négligés. Les réalisateurs de documentaires sérieux doivent au moins comprendre comment leurs films sont produits, mis en scène, tournés et montés, même s'ils ne peuvent pas tout faire eux-mêmes. Si vous n'êtes pas familiarisé avec les procédés techniques qui se cachent derrière la réalisation, vous trouverez surement que cela vaut la peine d'étudier la réalisation avant de tourner votre documentaire. Beaucoup d'universités dispensent des cours de réalisation, mais vous pouvez aussi acquérir de l'expérience pratique en travaillant sur des tournages et en passant devant ou derrière la caméra. Même si la plupart des réalisateurs ont suivi un cursus cinématographique, les connaissances pratiques peuvent supplanter des connaissances filmiques classiques. Par exemple, le comédien Louis C.K qui a réalisé des films et pour la télévision a acquis une expérience de réalisateur très tôt en travaillant au sein d'une chaine publique locale . Essayez d'utiliser le meilleur matériel possible. Empruntez l'équipement que vous ne pouvez pas vous payer et utilisez vos contacts pour avoir accès à du matériel. Vous ne devez pas forcément exactement savoir de quoi votre documentaire aura l'air avant de commencer à le tourner. Vous découvrirez probablement certaines choses qui changeront vos plans et vous offriront de nouvelles pistes d'investigation pendant que vous filmerez. Cependant, vous devriez vraiment avoir un plan avant de commencer le tournage. Avoir un plan vous laissera du temps pour programmer les interviews, gérer les conflits d'emploi du temps, etc. Votre plan doit inclure ce qui suit.   Les personnes que vous voulez interviewer. Prenez contact avec ces personnes le plus tôt possible pour programmer des entretiens. Les évènements particuliers que vous voulez enregistrer. Prévoyez de vous rendre et de revenir de ces évènements, d'acheter des billets si nécessaire et d'obtenir l'autorisation de filmer auprès des organisateurs des évènements. Les textes, images, dessins, musiques ou autres documents que vous voulez utiliser. Obtenez la permission de les utiliser auprès des créateurs avant de les ajouter à votre documentaire. Les reconstitutions que vous voulez filmer. Cherchez les acteurs, les accessoires et les lieux de tournage longtemps à l'avance.\n",
        "  14  En écrivant l'histoire de votre vie, vous en apprendrez beaucoup sur qui vous êtes et sur la façon dont vous appréhendez les défis, les joies, les opportunités et les difficultés qui jalonnent votre route. En écrivant votre histoire personnelle, vous aurez un aperçu de ce que vous avez appris au cours des expériences que vous avez traversées et comment ces expériences vous ont affectées. De cette façon, vous pourrez analyser comment vos expériences ont fait de vous celui que vous êtes et comment elles ont défini vos valeurs, votre comportement, vos croyances, vos défauts, vos idées préconçues, vos réactions et la façon dont vous interagissez avec votre environnement. Une fois que vous aurez écrit l'histoire de votre vie, analysez-vous en vous posant certaines questions.  Quels sont les thèmes récurrents de votre histoire ? Êtes-vous toujours celui que l'on sauve ou celui qui sauve les autres ? Votre thème dominant est-il l'impuissance ou au contraire le pouvoir ? Votre histoire est-elle une histoire d'amour, une comédie, un drame ou autre chose ? Si vous deviez donner un titre à votre histoire, quel serait-il ? Divisez votre histoire en chapitres. Pourquoi les chapitres sont-ils définis de la sorte ? Qu'est-ce qui a changé ? Qu'avez-vous appris ? Quels sont les titres de ces chapitres ? Avez-vous utilisé un qualificatif particulier pour vous définir ? L'avez-vous fait pour d'autres personnes ? Que signifient pour vous ces qualificatifs et que disent-ils de votre vision de vous-même, des autres et du reste du monde ? Quels types de mots utilisez-vous pour vous décrire, pour décrire les autres, pour décrire le reste du monde ? Que disent ces mots de votre histoire et de la façon dont vous l'avez vécue ? Une fois que vous aurez écrit votre histoire, vous devez décider de ce que cela signifie. Ce qui est intéressant dans le fait d'écrire votre propre histoire, ce que l'on appelle la thérapie narrative, c'est que cela vous montre que ce que vous pensez est important ou crucial dans votre existence. Cela met en lumière les moments de votre vie qui vous semblent importants ou qui valent la peine d'être notés. Cela montre également la façon dont vous vous percevez et dont vous percevez la trajectoire que votre vie a empruntée. Par exemple, si vous écrivez votre vie comme un drame, c'est peut-être que votre histoire vous semble dramatique et intense. Si vous l'avez écrite comme une comédie, c'est peut-être qu'elle vous parait drôle et gaie. Si vous l'avez écrite comme une histoire d'amour, vous êtes peut-être un incorrigible romantique qui vit peut-être le grand amour ou qui espère le vivre un jour. Même lorsque vous avez suivi toutes ces étapes, vous devez prendre conscience que cela prendra du temps. Il est important de comprendre que si vous vous connaissez déjà mieux ou si vous vous êtes bien analysé, vous devrez continuer à faire cela tout au long de votre vie. Votre personnalité et vos croyances peuvent changer avec le temps.\n",

Fouettez les ingrédients jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient bien mélangés et que le mélange commence à épaissir.  Vous pouvez remplacer l'extrait de vanille par de l'extrait d'amandes pour obtenir une saveur plus sophistiquée.  Vous pouvez aussi remplacer le pouding à la vanille par tout autre arôme, comme chocolat, caramel, cheese-cake, etc.\n",

Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 on Friday, March 4, 2016. (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n Los Angeles police confirmed Friday morning a knife was found on the former Brentwood property of O.J. Simpson and said they are investigating a report that it was discovered years ago by a construction worker who handed it over to authorities. \\n \\n A report, published Friday by TMZ and citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said a construction worker found a knife several years ago buried on the perimeter of the former Simpson home and gave it to a police officer working security for a nearby film shoot. \\n \\n Archive: The O.J. Simpson Slow-Speed Chase On June 17, 1994, an apparently suicidal Orenthal \\\"OJ\\\" Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings led police on a 60 mile slow-speed car chase through Los Angeles and Orange counties, captivating viewers glued to television sets. Simpson had failed to surrender to police earlier in the day, when he was slated to be charged in the murders of his ex-wife and her male friend. As police closed down the freeways and 20 cruisers followed Simpson, spectators filled the freeway overpasses, many cheering him on with signs reading \\\"Go O.J.\\\" (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n The officer, now retired, was recently ordered to surrender the knife for testing by authorities after he contacted a friend at the department for information about the 1994 murder case for which Simpson stood trial, according to the report. \\n \\n LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman told NBC4 Friday morning that police are investigating the report. \\n \\n The mansion on Rockingham Avenue in Brentwood, where Simpson lived when his ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death in June 1994, was demolished by a new owner in 1998. TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the knife was found sometime from \\\"several years ago to 1998.\\\" \\n \\n The Great White Bronco Chase \\n \\n \\\"We still don't know if that's an accurate account,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n Neiman confirmed at a Friday morning news conference that an individual identified by the officer as a construction worker gave the knife to him when he was working security at a film shoot near the former Simpson estate. The officer retired in the late 1990s, but it's not clear whether the officer was retired at the time the knife was found, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"If this story is accurate, I would think an LAPD officer would know that anytime you come into contact with evidence you should submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n The officer will likely not face administrative charges because he is retired, Neiman said, adding that an investigation will determine whether criminal charges are possible. \\n \\n Life and Times: OJ Simpson \\n \\n Police became aware of the knife within the last month, but authorities did not discuss details about how they obtained the item. It has been submitted to an LAPD forensics team for examination. \\n \\n It was not clear to whom the knife belonged and authorities are attempting to determine the identity of the individual who turned it over to the officer, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"With all cases that remain open, unless there's an actual arrest or conviction to prove we've actually closed the case, the case remains open,\\\" Neiman said of the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. \\n \\n Neiman did not provide a description of the knife at the Friday news conference, but multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the knife undergoing tests is a relatively inexpensive, smaller-bladed utility blade typically used by construction workers, gardeners, landscapers or other laborers. \\n \\n The murder weapon in the case has remained a mystery. A 15-inch retractable-blade knife that Simpson bought at Ross Cutlery in downtown Los Angeles drew the interest of murder trial prosecutors, but the defense presented the knife in a preliminary hearing. Tests later showed the knife in pristine condition with no signs it had been used in the double killing. \\n \\n LAPD Discusses Knife Found at Ex-OJ Simpson Home (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n In 1998, a residential construction crew found a folding-blade knife in Simpson's former neighborhood but police said there was no evidence to show it was related to any crime. \\n \\n The mansion, where Simpson married Brown in 1985, was one of the landmarks of the murder trial. The infamous white Ford Bronco pursuit from Orange County ended in the mansion's driveway. It's also where Det. Mark Fuhrman said he found a bloody glove during the investigation into the slayings of Brown and Goldman. \\n \\n Simpson was forced to sell the Rockingham Avenue estate to comply with requirements of the civil court judgment after the criminal trial. An investment banker hired a demolition crew to raze the house and clear the way for a new mansion four years later. \\n \\n \\\"It's not my house and I could care less,\\\" Simpson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview at the time the house was demolished. \\\"I am a sentimental guy, but there's things you've got to compartmentalize.\\\" \\n \\n The former NFL and USC football star was acquitted of murder in the slayings of ex-wife and Goldman, but a civil jury found him liable. In September 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas and charged with several felonies after an armed robbery and kidnapping at a hotel in an attempt to recover sports memorabilia. \\n \\n He was sentenced to 33 years in prison. \\n \\n OJ Trial: Key Players Then and Now \\n \\n No matter what is determined through the knife investigation, Simpson cannot be tried again in the Brown-Goldman murders because of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Attorney Carl Douglas, a member of Simpson's legal team that secured the 1995 acquittal, said an investigation involving the knife would be a waste of time and money. \\n \\n \\\"I am amazed at the latest frenzy surrounding this ridiculous frenzy about some knife found on OJ's former property,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"As a proud citizen of Los Angeles, I will be offended if the Los Angeles Police Department spends one minute of city time or one dollar of the city's limited resources chasing this ridiculous, supposed lead. I hope there are other investigations more deserving of the city's resources than this failed attempt, now 22 years old. \\n \\n \\\"OJ left the house two days after the murders and never returned until October 3rd, 1995. I certainly hope the LAPD used all of the resources then to scour every inch of his property looking for relevant evidence. It is pure fantasy to believe that there's anything relevant with this knife that has now been turned over. I'd rather talk about the Easter Bunny instead.\\\" ||||| ABC News reports investigators said preliminary information indicates the knife found on O.J. Simpson's old home is not the murder weapon in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.Capt. Andrew Neiman said the Los Angeles Police Department became aware of the item within the last month. It was allegedly recovered by a citizen at the property possibly around the time the site was demolished, which was in 1998.Trent Copeland, the attorney of retired officer George Maycott described the weapon as a 5-inch buck knife covered with dirt and mud. He said there were no obvious signs of blood on the knife. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the likely real murder weapon was bigger and possibly \\\"exotic.\\\"The item was found by a construction worker at the site, and he gave it to Maycott, who was working an off-duty movie job. Maycott, retired at the time, immediately called the West Los Angeles Police Department to tell them he was handed a knife, the attorney said. The person on the phone placed Maycott on hold, and said she spoke to a supervisor who said the case was over and there was nothing they could do due to double jeopardy, according to Copeland.Authorities said the retired officer held onto the knife and kept it in a tool box for 15 years until recently.Maycott's attorney said the retired officer was buying materials at the academy and asked someone for a records number on the Simpson case. Jokingly, Maycott decided to put the number on the knife and frame it. The weapon was taken into custody on Feb. 10 and Maycott did not resist, according to Copeland.\\\"I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer - if this story is accurate as we're being told - would know that any time you come into contact with evidence that you should and shall submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\\"I don't know what the circumstances are or why that didn't happen or if that's entirely accurate or if this whole story is possibly bogus from the get-go.\\\"The police department has asked for the citizen who turned over the knife to contact them.Authorities said they were still doing testing to check whether the weapon was connected to the murders. As part of the investigation, LAPD detectives were trying to piece together the timeline of exactly when the demolition of the property started and ended, and who obtained the knife and had possession of it from then until now, according to ABC News.Neiman said double jeopardy would be in place for Simpson.Simpson, a former football player, was acquitted of murder charges in the 1994 stabbings of his ex-wife and her friend. He is currently imprisoned in Nevada for a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.Goldman's public relations firm, Garson & Wright Public Relations, Inc., released the following statement from Fred and Kim Goldman:\\\"Until the LAPD completes its investigation of the recovered knife, the validity of the knife as it relates to Ron and Nicole's murder is purely speculative. It is not a shock to our family that stories like this are making headlines again. Being a victim/survivor is an ongoing process for all those impacted. We cannot validate every claim with a discussion, as it only creates more unnecessary hype and encourages the media circus. \\\" ||||| Marcia Clark is opening up about reliving O.J.

Azalea, who is Australian, wasn\\u2019t in time with her backing track, and, in the middle of a live performance, switched from her \\u201chip hop voice\\u201d to her real one, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, there\\u2019s something wrong with my ear.\\u201d \\n \\n Azalea is the only the second artist after the Beatles to have her first two songs occupy the top two spots on the Billboard chart simultaneously, with \\u201cFancy\\u201d at No. 1 and \\u201cProblem\\u201d at No. 2. \\u201cProblem\\u201d is by Ariana Grande but features Azalea. Minaj\\u2019s insult probably won\\u2019t do much to change that, but it\\u2019s certainly fun to talk about, especially since she provided some much-needed entertainment for a show that couldn\\u2019t seem to get its act together. \\n \\n The network saw fit to honor Lionel Richie with a lifetime achievement award, complete with a three-song tribute from John Legend, Ledisi and Yolanda Adams, and your typical talking head documentary-style commentary on the Commodores.

Now, the test will be whether Clinton can rise above the fray and focus on straight answers to outstanding questions about her handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and the private email setup she relied on while in office. \\n \\n Here\\u2019s POLITICO\\u2019s compilation of advice offered by experts of all stripes: \\n \\n Don\\u2019t lie \\n \\n It\\u2019s easy to dismiss a potential future indictment of Clinton for lying to Congress as the fantasy of a fevered conservative mind, but lawyers who prepare witnesses for Capitol Hill testimony say avoiding that unpleasant outcome would be at the top of their list. \\n \\n \\u201cThere\\u2019s a federal law saying you can\\u2019t lie to Congress and you can\\u2019t mislead Congress. It\\u2019s actually not all that unusual for congressional committees to refer people to the Justice Department for alleged false statements,\\u201d said Robert Kelner, a GOP lawyer with Covington & Burling. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to want to approach this from a political perspective and say things that will be directed to her political supporters, but there\\u2019s a tremendous tension between her political incentives and the advice she must be getting from her lawyers to be extremely factual.\\u201d \\n \\n Prosecutors coming after congressional witnesses over statements made in testimony is far from rare. Pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted in 2010 for testimony he gave about steroids in Major League Baseball. Sure, he was acquitted two years later after a trial, but who wants to go through that? \\n \\n Claims of false congressional testimony have triggered a series of criminal cases in recent years, including one against Steven Griles, a George W. Bush administration deputy secretary of the Interior who was caught up in the investigation into lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and another against former BP executive David Rainey, who was accused of understating how much oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (Griles pled guilty, while a judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Rainey.) \\n \\n There have also been calls for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to be prosecuted for answers he gave to Congress about the NSA\\u2019s then-classified phone surveillance efforts. He apologized, saying he misunderstood the question. No charges have been filed. \\n \\n The Iran-Contra scandal brought the largest flurry of lying-to-Congress charges in the past few decades, including indictments against Reagan National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Lt. Col Oliver North. Both men were convicted, but had their convictions overturned on appeal. \\n \\n So don\\u2019t shade the truth, even if tempted. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t speculate \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday won\\u2019t be her first public statements on Benghazi or on the email controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign, but she and her advisers have already encountered difficulties with claims made about the email situation that later proved incorrect. \\n \\n \\u201cHer biggest problem is inconsistent statements,\\u201d said one prominent Democratic lawyer, who asked not to be named. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the risk of any person going into a situation like this. This is the stuff of independent counsel investigations.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she began using her private Clintonemail.com account on March 18, 2009, but last month the Pentagon produced messages that she exchanged with Gen. David Petraeus on that address weeks earlier. Clinton aides said it now appears that while the server was set up on that March date, the account became active earlier. No one seems sure if or where messages from that period were stored. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s lawyer also told Congress in March that no emails from her account from her tenure as secretary of state \\u201creside on the server or any back-up systems associated with the server.\\u201d However, the FBI reportedly has recovered some of those messages, and recently, a service provider to Clinton\\u2019s information technology contractor revealed that it had back-up of some of the server's contents. \\n \\n Clinton also declared at the outset of the furor in March that she was confident there was no classified information in her account. \\u201cThere is no classified material,\\u201d she told reporters. \\u201dI\\u2019m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.\\u201d \\n \\n Now, the State Department has classified more than 400 of the emails with more to come. And the intelligence community says some contained information that was classified \\u201cTOP SECRET\\u201d or higher at the time. Clinton has since changed her stance to say nothing she received was \\u201cmarked classified.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton also has said repeatedly there\\u2019s no indication anyone tried to breach her server\\u2019s security, But a Senate committee found evidence of potential intrusions from China S. Korea and Germany after she left office but while the server still contained her email archive. \\n \\n For both political and legal reasons, Clinton needs to avoid making any more declarations that are later overtaken by the facts. \\n \\n \\u201cIn life, you never know what you don\\u2019t know, therefore you need to be careful not to go out on a limb to assert facts that are not rock solid,\\u201d said Ron Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore Law School and formerly the Justice Department\\u2019s top adviser to officials testifying on the Hill. \\n \\n Expect Clinton to deflect to others as often as she can, relaying what others told her about Benghazi or her emails. She did just this in August, submitting a declaration under penalty of perjury that appeared to certify all her work related emails had been turned over to the State Department. But on closer examination, it said simply that \\u201con information and belief\\u201d others did the review. \\n \\n Given that her emails already made public show her struggling with technology like fax machines, one easy out for Clinton will be to profess ignorance about any technical questions about her computer setup. \\n \\n \\u201cI think you will hear a lot of caveats,\\u201d Kelner said. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t rile the FBI \\n \\n The FBI team investigating potential security breaches involving Clinton\\u2019s private server will undoubtedly tune in to her testimony. Officially there\\u2019s no indication that Clinton is the target of the inquiry or even that it\\u2019s a criminal probe. \\n \\n Clinton would be wise not to follow President Barack Obama\\u2019s example of dismissing the idea that the private server posed any national security threat, lawyers said. \\u201cThis is not a situation in which America\\u2019s national security was endangered,\\u201d Obama declared recently on CBS\\u2019s \\u201c60 Minutes.\\u201d The comment reportedly angered FBI agents working on the inquiry into Clinton\\u2019s server because it seemed to prejudge the outcome of their probe. \\n \\n Experts urged Clinton to treat the classification issue seriously, even as she maintains she didn\\u2019t knowingly handle anything classified on her private account. \\n \\n \\u201cShe needs to say she takes this seriously, that this is something that needs to be looked at by the appropriate agencies and, hopefully, lessons learned are derived from this,\\u201d said Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represents intelligence agency personnel. He said Clinton can also legitimately decline to go into details about any specific cases by saying she \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t want to speak out of turn as departments argue amongst themselves about what should have been classified, then or now.\\u201d \\n \\n Don\\u2019t joke \\n \\n Clinton has already tried humor in an effort to defuse the email controversy, but that approach didn\\u2019t work out particularly well. \\n \\n \\u201cYou may have seen that I recently launched a Snapchat account,\\u201d Clinton said during a speech to Iowa Democrats in August. \\u201cI love it. I love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\\u201d \\n \\n Later that month, she answered with a flip response when a reporter asked whether her server was \\u201cwiped\\u201d at her direction. \\u201cLike with a cloth or something?\\u201d she replied. \\n \\n The jokes didn\\u2019t sit well with some Clinton donors and advisers, who thought she appeared to be belittling legitimate concerns about government transparency. \\n \\n Probably best to leave the jokes aside this time, particularly since the House hearing is supposed to be focused on Benghazi and the brutal deaths of four Americans. With that grim context, humor might be in poor taste. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t join the food fight \\n \\n Clinton has signaled recently that if Benghazi committee members come after her, she\\u2019s ready to throw back at them some righteous indignation. \\n \\n \\u201cLook at the situation they chose to exploit to go after me for political reasons--the death of four Americans in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said angrily on NBC earlier this month. \\u201cThis committee was set up as they have admitted for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. I would have never done that, and if I were President and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.\\u201d \\n \\n At a Senate Benghazi hearing in 2013, a frustrated outburst from Clinton grabbed headlines. \\\"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\\" Clinton said. \\\"What difference \\u2013 at this point, what difference does it make?\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign has taken a decidedly combative tone with the Benghazi panel recently, shifting away from litigating facts of the email dispute and towards heated claims that Gowdy\\u2019s effort is brazenly partisan. Clinton may choose to keep that up Thursday. But some Capitol Hill vets say rather than claiming unfairness from the witness table, she\\u2019d score more points if she lets the panel\\u2019s five Democratic members slug it out with the GOP. \\n \\n \\u201cThe witness should stand back and not get in the fray of a Congressional food fight,\\u201d Weich said. \\u201cThe Democrats on this committee are very, very adept at defending witnesses from unfair attacks\\u2026Ranking Member Cumming and his troops will do their job and protect here. She doesn\\u2019t need to be the one to raise points when her allies on the committee are ready to do so.\\u201d \\n \\n ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \\u2014 After months of buildup, Hillary Rodham Clinton finally takes center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led investigation into the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. \\n \\n In this Oct. 16, 2015, photo, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during a town hall meeting in Keene, N.H. Clinton is taking center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led... (Associated Press) \\n \\n Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, testifies from a position of political strength as her potential rival for the nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, announced Wednesday that he will not jump into the presidential race and she rides the momentum of a solid debate performance. \\n \\n In advance of her testimony, Clinton campaign released a summary that said she is appearing before the committee to honor the memory of the four Americans killed in Benghazi. The summary said Clinton will testify that Benghazi was a tragedy that must be learned from but that America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. \\n \\n \\\"To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from Benghazi,\\\" she will say, according to the summary. \\n \\n Clinton will vow to pursue a \\\"smart brand of leadership\\\" that balances diplomacy, development and defense, and will say this approach to diplomacy involves an element of risk-taking that can never be eliminated outright. \\n \\n At the same time, the Benghazi committee is on the defensive as the panel's GOP chairman scrambles to deflect comments by fellow Republicans that the inquiry is aimed at hurting Clinton's presidential bid. \\n \\n Clinton faces a formidable challenge as she tries to explain security lapses at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, the slow military response to the violence and the Obama administration's changing narrative about who was responsible for the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, and why the attacks were launched. \\n \\n In a high-stakes, day-long appearance that could solidify her hold on the Democratic nomination or raise doubts about her candidacy, Clinton also is certain to face questions about her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. \\n \\n The committee also faces a make-or-break moment. The panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, and other Republican investigators know their questioning of Clinton could revive the beleaguered panel's credibility or undermine it even further. \\n \\n A new Associated Press-Gfk poll offers solace to both sides. While the investigation into the attacks is a burning issue for Republicans but not the broader public, Americans are more likely to view the investigation as justified rather than as a political attack on Clinton, the poll finds. \\n \\n Many Americans don't have an opinion about Clinton's handling of the investigation. Four in 10 say they neither approve nor disapprove of how she has answered questions about the attack, while 20 percent approve and 37 percent disapprove. \\n \\n Americans also are divided on Clinton's emails. More than half of those polled view her use of a private server as a minor problem or no problem at all, compared with 1 in 3 who think it is a major problem. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans call it a major problem. \\n \\n Gowdy pledged in a recent interview that the hearing will be \\\"Benghazi-centric,\\\" focused on security before and during the attacks. Some questions on Clinton's emails are likely, Gowdy said, but he maintains that his approach may \\\"shock you with fairness.\\\" \\n \\n Clinton has said the use of a private server was a mistake. \\n \\n The hearing comes amid an escalating partisan feud on the 12-member committee, which has spent more than $4.5 million since its creation in May 2014. \\n \\n Democrats have complained about \\\"selective and out-of-context leaks\\\" that they said mischaracterized testimony by top Clinton aides and other witnesses. They say the panel has devolved into partisan harassment intended to hurt Clinton's bid for president. \\n \\n Gowdy and other Republicans say the panel has been and remains focused on those killed in Benghazi and on providing a definitive account of the attacks. There have been seven previous investigations. \\n \\n \\\"This has never been political for us,\\\" said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., a member of the Benghazi panel. \\\"This has always been about finding out the truth.\\\" \\n \\n While Thursday's hearing has drawn worldwide attention, \\\"the investigation isn't solely about Secretary Clinton. She's just one piece of a much larger investigation,\\\" Roby said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the committee has been a bust. \\n \\n \\\"After 17 months and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, the Select Committee on Benghazi has uncovered nothing that alters our core understanding of the facts as revealed by the other (seven) investigations,\\\" said Schiff, who has called for the committee to be disbanded. \\n \\n \\\"When you consider the committee's obsessive focus on attacking Secretary Clinton, the reason becomes quite clear: the (GOP) majority has little interest in the events in Benghazi except to the degree they can be used to diminish her standing in the polls,\\\" Schiff said. \\n \\n ___ \\n \\n Follow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| Play Facebook \\n \\n Twitter \\n \\n Embed The 4 Types of Benghazi Attack Lines That GOP Candidates Use 1:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \\n \\n By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans say they\\u2019re unsatisfied with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, according to results from a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \\n \\n But a plurality of respondents believe that the congressional investigation into the attack is unfair and politically motivated. \\n \\n And the public is essentially divided over the importance of Clinton\\u2019s private email server, with 47 percent of Americans saying it\\u2019s an important factor in deciding their vote, and another 44 percent saying it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n These findings come ahead of Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where the 2012 terrorist attack, Clinton\\u2019s private email server and allegations (even from fellow Republicans) that the committee was established to hurt Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign will all be subjects of discussion. \\n \\n The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is seen in flames after an attack that killed four Americans in 2012 while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI / Reuters \\n \\n And the findings in the poll tend to break down by party line. \\n \\n Forty-four percent of Americans say that they\\u2019re not satisfied with Clinton\\u2019s response to the Benghazi attack in 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state. That includes 77 percent of Republican respondents, 40 percent of independents but just 14 percent of Democrats. \\n \\n By contrast, 27 percent of Americans are satisfied with her response \\u2013 including 51 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents but just 6 percent of Republicans. \\n \\n Read the full poll here. \\n \\n Meanwhile, 36 percent of Americans think the current congressional investigation into the Benghazi attacks is unfair and too partisan (that includes 53 percent of Democrats); 29 percent of Americans believe it\\u2019s fair and impartial (including 50 percent of Republicans); and another 35 percent don\\u2019t know enough. \\n \\n Regarding Clinton\\u2019s private email server, 47 percent say it will be an important factor in their upcoming vote, versus 44 percent who disagree. \\n \\n And once again, these numbers are divided by party: 76 percent of Republicans believe Clinton\\u2019s private server is important to their vote, while 70 percent of Democrats say it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s general-election standing improves (slightly) \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll also finds that Clinton has slightly improved her general-election standing. She leads Republican Ben Carson by two points in a hypothetical match up, 47 percent to 45 percent. But a month ago, Carson had a one-point edge over Clinton, 46 percent to 45 percent. \\n \\n Clinton also leads Marco Rubio by one point (46 percent to 45 percent) and Ted Cruz by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). \\n \\n By comparison, Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is ahead of Carson by one point (44 percent to 43 percent), Rubio by four points (45 percent to 41 percent) and Cruz by 12 points (50 percent to 38 percent). \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll shows a generic Democrat holding a one-point advantage a generic Republican in a presidential contest, 41 percent to 40 percent; it was 38 percent to 38 percent a month ago. \\n \\n Comparing Clinton\\u2019s and Sanders\\u2019 attributes \\n \\n When Democratic primary voters were asked to judge Clinton and Sanders on several different attributes, Clinton\\u2019s top attributes in the poll were being knowledgeable and experienced to handle the presidency (88 percent gave her high marks here versus 56 percent for Sanders) and sharing your positions on issues (71 percent for Clinton, 55 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s worst attributes among Democratic voters: bringing real change to the direction of the country (58 percent give Clinton high marks here, versus 58 percent for Sanders) and being honest and straightforward (53 percent for Clinton, 72 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n And only 26 percent of all voters give Clinton high marks for being honest and straightforward, compared with 50 percent who give her bad marks -- essentially unchanged from the April NBC/WSJ poll. \\n \\n Democratic Party vs. GOP: In the mainstream or not? \\n \\n The new NBC/WSJ poll also measured which political party was in the mainstream \\u2013 or outside the mainstream \\u2013 on six different issues: \\n \\n Gay marriage: 63 percent said the Democratic Party was in the mainstream on this issue, versus just 29 percent who said that about the Republican Party; \\n \\n Abortion: 54 percent said Democrats were in the mainstream here, versus 33 percent who said Republicans; \\n \\n Climate change: 54 percent mainstream for Democrats, 30 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Immigration: 46 percent mainstream for Democrats, 43 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Fiscal issues such as taxing and spending: 47 percent mainstream for Republicans, 42 percent mainstream for Democrats; \\n \\n Guns: 51 percent mainstream for Republicans, 38 percent mainstream for Democrats. \\n \\n Obama job-approval rating: 46 percent \\n \\n Finally, the poll finds 46 percent approving of President Obama\\u2019s job, compared with 49 percent who disapprove -- it was 47 percent-47 percent a month ago. \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 of 1,000 adults (including nearly 400 via cell phone), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. ||||| Photo \\n \\n Q. What is the mission of the House Select Committee on Benghazi? \\n \\n A. The Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, Libya, as the panel is officially known, was created in May 2014 to look into what happened before, during and after the 2012 attack on two American outposts \\u2014 one belonging to the State Department, the other to the C.I.A. \\u2014 in Benghazi. Seven congressional panels had investigated the attacks, but Speaker John A. Boehner said the administration had covered up what occurred. Democrats said that Mr. Boehner created the committee to serve as a vehicle to undermine Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign. \\n \\n Mr. Boehner appointed Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor popular with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, to lead the committee. The panel received little attention until March 2015, when it was revealed that it had been given emails about Libya from a personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively relied on when she was secretary of state. \\n \\n Q. What questions will Mrs. Clinton face about the Benghazi attacks? \\n \\n A. Lawmakers are likely to focus on Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s response to early warnings of increasingly dangerous security conditions in Benghazi \\u2014 warnings that department officials failed to heed, an independent inquiry into the attack concluded in December 2012. That inquiry sharply criticized the State Department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and for relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound. But the report did not place blame on anyone higher than the level of assistant secretary. \\n \\n Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that she was briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi State Department post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. \\n \\n Q:. What do we still not know about the Benghazi attack? \\n \\n A. Republicans contend that the administration has not provided an answer about why Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser who at the time was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, went on national television the Sunday after the attacks and provided an inaccurate account about what occurred. Ms. Rice said that the attacks were spontaneously spawned by an anti-American video and were not preplanned by terrorists. Mrs. Clinton will probably be asked about the administration\\u2019s initial narrative about the attacks. And, she will likely be asked why the administration had Ms. Rice appear on television instead of the secretary herself. \\n \\n Q. If the committee is investigating the attacks, why is Mrs. Clinton going to be asked about her emails? \\n \\n A. The emails about Libya that the committee received had never been provided to any of the congressional committees that investigated the attacks. Mr. Gowdy has said that he has the right to investigate Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email arrangement because the committee\\u2019s charter calls for him to look into how the administration complied with other congressional inquiries into the incident. Mrs. Clinton and Democrats on the committee have said that Mr. Gowdy has no right to investigate her emails because they are not related to the attacks. \\n \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n \\n Q. What do the Republicans need to do for the hearing to be considered a success for them? \\n \\n A. The Republicans need to placate their base without appearing overly partisan. It is unclear if they can do both. The base would like to see the committee embarrass Mrs. Clinton and get her to make a significant gaffe or admit to some type of wrongdoing. But if the committee members appear overzealous, they will open themselves up to criticism from Democrats who will argue that the Republicans are just trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign. \\n \\n Q. If Mrs. Clinton is having a good day, what will that look like? \\n \\n A. Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s biggest challenge is to appear composed and patient during many hours of questioning. Some Democrats believe that the Republicans will spend the first several hours of the hearing asking Mrs. Clinton about the Benghazi attacks as a way to wear her down, and then question her about emails in the final round. \\n \\n The last time Mrs. Clinton testified before Congress was in 2013, when she appeared before House and Senate committees looking into the Benghazi attacks. That day, Mrs. Clinton accepted responsibility for the security lapses in Benghazi, but said that requests for additional security at the State Department outpost were not sent directly to her. At one point, she became exasperated with the questioning and said there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attacks had been characterized in their early hours. \\u201cWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\u2019\\u2019 she said, her voice rising. \\u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\\u201d \\n \\n Q. What do we still not know about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private email account? \\n \\n A. It is still unclear who at the State Department gave Mrs. Clinton approval to use a private rather than an official government account. It is also unclear why Mrs. Clinton did not hand her emails over to the State Department when she left office in 2013. ||||| Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was grilled for hours today before the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. \\n \\n Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \\n \\n Washington observers and political junkies have been fixated on this testimony for months, waiting in anticipation to see what impact it may have on her campaign. \\n \\n The testimony featured fireworks from members of congress on both sides of the aisle and left Clinton in the hot seat for around 11 hours, including breaks, beginning just after 10 a.m. and wrapping at 9 p.m. All told, she spent more than 8 hours testifying. \\n \\n Some of the strongest testimony so far, most likely to be seized upon by critics of Clinton, was the exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Jordan pointed to two emails -- the first was a note providing a readout of a call between Clinton and the Egyptian prime minister sent on Sept. 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack. The email quotes Clinton as having said, \\u201cWe know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack -- not a protest.\\u201d \\n \\n This is significant because it is new evidence, directly from Clinton, that supports Republican claims that the administration had strong reasons to believe the attack was planned well before U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on television a week later and claimed it was motivated by an anti-Islam video. \\n \\n The second email is from Clinton to Diane Reynolds, an alias used by Chelsea Clinton, on Sept. 11, the day of the attack, in which she wrote, \\u201cTwo of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group: The Ambassador, whom I handpicked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same tomorrow.\\u201d \\n \\n This email also shows she was making a direct assessment, at least in private, that this had to do with al-Qaeda and not a protest. This is important to Republicans and will serve to further their belief that much of the response to the Benghazi attack was calculated to protect Obama politically. \\n \\n Clinton had a clear response: \\u201cWhen I was speaking to the Egyptian prime minister or in the other two examples you showed, we had been told by Ansar al-Sharia [a militia group] that they took credit for it. It wasn't until about 24 more hours later that they retracted taking credit for it,\\\" she said. \\n \\n Clinton also defended herself by saying she was sorry her version of events didn\\u2019t \\\"fit your narrative.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Why didn't you just speak plain to the American people?\\\" Jordan asked. \\n \\n \\\"I did,\\\" Clinton replied. \\\"If you look at my statement, as opposed to what I was saying to the Egyptian prime minister, I did state clearly. I said it again in more detail the next morning, as did the president.\\\" \\n \\n That was just one exchange in a hearing that began with heated opening statements from Gowdy and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. Gowdy said that previous investigations into the Benghazi attack were \\u201cnot thorough\\u201d and blamed Democrats on the Benghazi Committee for not taking the current investigation seriously. \\n \\n Cummings fired back in his opening statement. \\u201cClearly, it is possible to conduct a serious, bipartisan investigation. What is impossible is for any reasonable person to continue denying that Republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive effort to derail Secretary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign,\\\" Cummings said. \\n \\n Gowdy denied those claims directly to Clinton. \\n \\n \\u201cI understand there are people, frankly, in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you,\\u201d Gowdy said. \\u201cLet me assure you it is not and let me assure you why it is not. This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during and after the attacks that killed them.\\u201d \\n \\n Gowdy said her testimony had been delayed not because they wanted to hurt her politically, but because of her private email account that made it so difficult to request her records from the State Department. \\n \\n \\u201cMadame secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email. We signed up to investigate and, therefore, honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us,\\\" Gowdy said. \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n In Clinton\\u2019s opening remarks, she reiterated that she knew Ambassador Stevens personally and was the one who asked him to serve in Libya. She said the U.S. government needs bipartisan agreement when it comes to foreign policy, despite disagreements. \\n \\n \\u201cMy challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself. Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead, to learn the right lessons, to rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Gowdy deferred to one of his colleagues and elected not to conduct the first round of questions. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Illinois, asked the first questions. He chose to focus on why the U.S. was in Libya to begin with, but the premise of his questions was lost after repeatedly interrupting himself to remark on Clinton\\u2019s use of notes. \\n \\n \\u201cI can pause while you read your notes from your staff,\\u201d Roskam said. \\n \\n Before turning on her microphone Clinton remarked that she is capable of doing more than one thing at a time. \\n \\n Later during the hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, had a contentious exchange with Clinton on a number of topics. \\n \\n Pompeo asked why no one had been fired after an attack that killed a U.S. ambassador for the first time in over 30 years. He also wanted to know why journalist Sidney Blumenthal had such good access to Clinton, while, as Pompeo alleges, those who worked for her did not share that same access. \\n \\n Clinton said Blumenthal was a friend who was simply sharing information and was not working for the U.S. government. Some of that information she passed on and some she did not, Clinton said. She later said he was not her main adviser on Libya, as many of her critics have alleged. \\n \\n Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, used email printouts as a prop, suggesting there were not enough emails about certain events leading up to the attack, eliciting a response from Clinton that most of the communication she had was not done over email. \\n \\n Rep. Martha Roby, R-Alabama, tried to pin Clinton down over a Feb. 9, 2012, email from State Department staffers that suggested Clinton was unaware if the U.S. had a presence in Benghazi at all. Clinton said the people who sent that email were not members of her staff and that they got it wrong. \\n \\n \\u201cOf course I knew we had a presence in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, used his time to attack the committee forcefully. He said the committee had an obsession over her email, evidenced by the questions so far. He attacked Gowdy\\u2019s opening statement, saying it offered no new facts, and said he didn\\u2019t think there was a need to form the committee in the first place. He criticized Roskom for using his time to ask a series of questions about why the U.S. was in Libya. \\n \\n \\u201cThat\\u2019s not about Benghazi,\\u201d Smith said, then saying to Clinton, \\u201cThey are making this about you.\\\" \\n \\n In one emotional exchange, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked Clinton what it was like \\\"to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Congressman, it's a very personally painful accusation. It has been rejected and disproven by nonpartisan dispassionate investigators,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"Nevertheless, having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me. I lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done.\\\" \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n The line of questioning about Sidney Blumenthal that erupted into fireworks between Gowdy and Cummings before the lunch break continued in the afternoon, with Republicans attempting to argue that Blumenthal had unfettered access to Clinton at all times, while someone like Ambassador Stevens did not. Clinton is strongly rejected that assertion, saying Stevens would have had a variety of ways to contact her office. \\n \\n \\\"I have said it before and I will say it again. I'll say it as many times as is necessary to respond. Chris Stevens communicated regularly with the members of my staff. He did not raise security with the members of my staff,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"I communicated with him about certain issues. He did not raise security with me. He raised security with the security professionals. Now, I know that's not the answer you want to hear because it's being asked in many different ways by committee members. But those are the facts, Mr. Chairman.\\\" \\n \\n Democrats on the committee used their time for the most part to question the integrity of the committee. Adam Smith again led the charge. \\n \\n \\u201cThe one thing said that is clearly the farthest from the truth is that this is not a prosecution,\\\" Smith said. \\\"If you listen to the other side, this is unquestionably exactly that -- a prosecution. ... If we can learn something new about what happened in Benghazi, that might be helpful, but right now this committee is not doing a service to the four people who died or their families or to preventing any of these future incidents from happening.\\u201d \\n \\n Later in the hearing, Roskam added a dramatic flare. \\n \\n \\\"What's your responsibility to Benghazi? That's my question,\\\" Roskam said. \\n \\n Clinton replied: \\\"Well, my responsibility was to be briefed and to discuss with the security experts and the policy experts whether we would have a post in Benghazi. Whether we would continue it. Whether we would make it permanent. As I said repeatedly throughout the day, no one ever recommended closing the post in Benghazi.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"No one recommended closing but you had two ambassadors that made several, several requests and here is basically what happened to their requests,\\\" Roskam said, ripping up paper in front of Clinton. \\\"They were torn up.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Well, that's just not true congressman,\\\" Clinton said. \\n \\n The lead-up to today's testimony has seen vicious political sniping from Democrats on the committee, who have seized on remarks in recent days from two Republican congressman and one former committee staffer, each of whom suggested publicly that the committee has disproportionately focused its attention on attacking Clinton. \\n \\n Gowdy has vehemently denied those claims, calling on his colleagues to \\\"shut up\\\" about what they don't know. Last Sunday, Gowdy said in an interview with CBS he plans to question Clinton about her role in denying requests to increase security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi prior to the attack. He said thousands of previously unseen emails to and from Stevens obtained by his committee will help inform those questions. \\n \\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May of 2014 with the purpose of conducting a full and complete investigation of the 2012 attack. Prior to Clinton's testimony today, the committee had held only three public hearings. Most of the testimony it has received so far has come in private sessions. \\n \\n The aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the nearby CIA annex instantly became a source of political tension. President Obama faced questions about the military response, allegations he misled the public about the nature the attack, and lax diplomatic security in a war zone, all as he awaited a vote on his reelection the following month. \\n \\n Numerous investigations and reports were written about what happened both on that night and in the lead up to the attack, and what needed to be done to ensure it wouldn't happen again. Two of the higher-profile reports were conducted by the Accountability Review Board (ARB), convened by Clinton herself who was Secretary of State at the time, and another later on by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee. \\n \\n In December of 2012, the ARB concluded that there was no protest before the attack (which the Obama administration has previously alleged), that the terrorist bore sole responsibility for the loss of life, and that \\\"systematic failures of leadership and management deficiencies\\\" at the State Department led to an \\\"inadequate\\\" security posture. \\n \\n Clinton was never directly implicated in the report. Clinton has admitted that the State Department could have done more to address security needs in Benghazi prior to the attack, but said those decisions were left to other people and she has denied any wrongdoing. \\n \\n Evan Vucci/AP Photo \\n \\n The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence focused on the CIA's response to the attack following accusations personnel on the ground were instructed to delay their response to the consulate, which was being overrun by militants less than one mile way. The report concluded that no such order had been given, despite contradictory witness accounts given by some contracted security officers who were there that night. It also concluded that a mixed group, including Al Qaeda affiliates, were responsible for the attacks. It found that there had been intelligence to support the administrations claims that the attack was borne out of a protest, but said there was early intelligence to counter that false assessment as well. The report declared itself as the \\\"definitive House statement\\\" on the Intelligence Community's involvement in the Benghazi attack. \\n \\n Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Paul Shanley, who was convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, 65 miles west of Boston, after his release from the Old Colony Correctional Center, where he served a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware. His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" security systems and to make sure every child leaves with an adult. \\u201cIt\\u2019s terrible ... that he\\u2019s moving across the street, but there\\u2019s nobody who is better to be his neighbor than me because all I do is make kids safe,\\\" Lask tells the Boston Herald. As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, the AP reports that he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender, though psychologists citing Shanley's advanced age and health issues concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. \\\"I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to ... be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,\\\" says Shanley's lawyer. \\\"Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,\\\" argues an attorney who represented dozens of Shanley's accusers.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? \\\"Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,\\\" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, \\\"the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,\\\" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment.

The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer.
